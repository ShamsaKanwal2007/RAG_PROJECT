              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/Emailing Eric Matthes - Python Crash Course-No Starch Press (2023) (3).pdf', 'page': 28}, page_content='PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION\\nThe response to the first and second editions of Python Crash Course has \\nbeen overwhelmingly positive. More than one million copies are in print, \\nincluding translations in over 10 languages. I’ve received letters and emails \\nfrom readers as young as 10, as well as from retirees who want to learn to \\nprogram in their free time. Python Crash Course  is being used in middle \\nschools and high schools, and also in college classes. Students who are \\nassigned more advanced textbooks are using Python Crash Course as a com-\\npanion text for their classes and finding it a worthwhile supplement. People \\nare using it to enhance their skills on the job, change careers, and start \\nworking on their own side projects. In short, people are using the book for \\nthe full range of purposes I had hoped they would, and much more.\\nThe opportunity to write a third edition of Python Crash Course has been \\nthoroughly enjoyable. Although Python is a mature language, it continues to \\nevolve as every language does. My main goal in revising the book is to keep \\nit a well-curated introductory Python course. By reading this book, you’ll \\nlearn everything you need to start working on your own projects, and you’ll \\nbuild a solid foundation for all of your future learning as well. I’ve updated \\nsome sections to reflect newer, simpler ways of doing things in Python. I’ve \\nalso clarified some sections where certain details of the language were not \\npresented as accurately as they could have been. All the projects have been \\ncompletely updated using popular, well-maintained libraries that you can \\nconfidently use to build your own projects.'),\n",

This chapter also \\nfeatures Python’s newly improved error messages, which provide much \\nmore specific information to help you troubleshoot your code when \\nsomething goes wrong.\\n•\\t Chapter\\xa010 uses the pathlib module for working with files. This is a \\nmuch simpler approach to reading from and writing to files.\\n•\\t Chapter\\xa011 uses pytest to write automated tests for the code you write. \\nThe pytest library has become the industry standard tool for writing \\ntests in Python. It’s friendly enough to use for your first tests, and if you \\npursue a career as a Python programmer, you’ll use it in professional \\nsettings as well.\\n•\\t The Alien Invasion  project in Chapters 12−14 includes a setting to \\ncontrol the frame rate, which makes the game run more consistently \\nacross different operating systems. A simpler approach is used to build \\nthe fleet of aliens, and the overall organization of the project has been \\ncleaned up as well.\\n•\\t The data visualization projects in Chapters 15–17 use the most recent \\nfeatures of Matplotlib and Plotly. The Matplotlib visualizations feature \\nupdated style settings. The random walk project has a small improvement \\nthat increases the accuracy of the plots, which means you’ll see a wider \\nvariety of patterns emerge each time you generate a new walk. All the \\nprojects featuring Plotly now use the Plotly Express module, which lets \\nyou generate your initial visualizations with just a few lines of code. You \\ncan easily explore a variety of visualizations before committing to one \\nkind of plot, and then focus on refining individual elements of that plot.\\n•\\t The Learning Log project in Chapters 18−20 is built using the latest ver-\\nsion of Django and styled using the latest version of Bootstrap. Some parts \\nof the project have been renamed to make it easier to follow the overall \\norganization of the project. The project is now deployed to Platform.sh, \\na modern hosting service for Django projects. The deployment process \\nis controlled by YAML configuration files, which give you a great deal of \\ncontrol over how your project is deployed. This approach is consistent with \\nhow professional programmers deploy modern Django projects.\\n•\\t Appendix A has been fully updated to recommend current best practices \\nfor installing Python on all major operating systems. Appendix B includes \\ndetailed instructions for setting up VS Code, and brief descriptions of \\nmost of the major text editors and IDEs in current use. Appendix C  \\ndirects readers to several of the most popular online resources for getting'),\n",

Appendix D continues to offer a mini crash course in using Git for \\nversion control. Appendix E is brand new for the third edition. Even with \\na good set of instructions for deploying the apps you create, there are \\nmany things that can go wrong. This appendix offers a detailed trouble-\\nshooting guide that you can use when the deployment process doesn’t \\nwork on the first try.\\n•\\t The index has been thoroughly updated to allow you to use Python \\nCrash Course as a reference for all of your future Python projects.\\nThank you for reading Python Crash Course!

Bill Pollock invited me to \\nwrite an introductory book, and I deeply appreciate that original offer. Liz \\nChadwick has worked on all three editions, and the book is better because \\nof her ongoing involvement. Eva Morrow brought fresh eyes to this new edi-\\ntion, and her insights have improved the book as well. I appreciate Doug \\nMcNair’s guidance in using proper grammar, without becoming overly for -\\nmal. Jennifer Kepler has supervised the production work, which turns my \\nmany files into a polished final product.\\nThere are many people at No Starch Press who have helped make this \\nbook a success but whom I haven’t had the chance to work with directly. No \\nStarch has a fantastic marketing team, who go beyond just selling books; \\nthey make sure readers find the books that are likely to work well for them \\nand help them reach their goals. No Starch also has a strong foreign-rights \\ndepartment. Python Crash Course has reached readers around the world, in \\nmany languages, due to the diligence of this team. To all of these people \\nwhom I haven’t worked with individually, thank you for helping Python \\nCrash Course  find its audience.\\nI’d like to thank Kenneth Love, the technical reviewer for all three \\neditions of Python Crash Course. I met Kenneth at PyCon one year, and \\ntheir enthusiasm for the language and the Python community has been a \\nconstant source of professional inspiration ever since.

I wrote my first program on a \\nkit computer that my dad had assembled in our base -\\nment. The computer consisted of nothing more than  \\na bare motherboard connected to a keyboard without a case, and its moni -\\ntor was a bare cathode ray tube. My initial program was a simple number \\nguessing game, which looked something like this:\\nI'm thinking of a number! Try to guess the number I'm thinking of: 25\\nToo low! Guess again: 50\\nToo high! Guess again: 42\\nThat's it! Would you like to play again? (yes/no) no\\nThanks for playing!\"),\n",

There’s real satisfaction in \\nbuilding something with a purpose, that solves a problem. The software I \\nwrite now meets more significant needs than my childhood efforts did, but \\nthe sense of satisfaction I get from creating a program that works is still \\nlargely the same.\\nWho Is This Book For?\\nThe goal of this book is to bring you up to speed with Python as quickly as \\npossible so you can build programs that work—games, data visualizations, \\nand web applications—while developing a foundation in programming that \\nwill serve you well for the rest of your life. Python Crash Course is written for \\npeople of any age who have never programmed in Python or have never \\nprogrammed at all. This book is for those who want to learn the basics of \\nprogramming quickly so they can focus on interesting projects, and those \\nwho like to test their understanding of new concepts by solving meaningful \\nproblems. Python Crash Course is also perfect for teachers at all levels who \\nwant to offer their students a project-based introduction to programming. \\nIf you’re taking a college class and want a friendlier introduction to Python \\nthan the text you’ve been assigned, this book can make your class easier as \\nwell. If you’re looking to change careers, Python Crash Course can help you \\nmake the transition into a more satisfying career track. It has worked well \\nfor a wide variety of readers, with a broad range of goals.\\nWhat Can You Expect to Learn?\\nThe purpose of this book is to make you a good programmer in general \\nand a good Python programmer in particular. You’ll learn efficiently and \\nadopt good habits as you gain a solid foundation in general programming \\nconcepts. After working your way through Python Crash Course, you should \\nbe ready to move on to more advanced Python techniques, and your next \\nprogramming language will be even easier to grasp.\\nIn Part I of this book, you’ll learn basic programming concepts you \\nneed to know to write Python programs. These concepts are the same as \\nthose you’d learn when starting out in almost any programming language. \\nYou’ll learn about different kinds of data and the ways you can store data in \\nyour programs. You’ll build collections of data, such as lists and dictionar -\\nies, and you’ll work through those collections in efficient ways. You’ll learn \\nto use while loops and if statements to test for certain conditions, so you \\ncan run specific sections of code while those conditions are true and run \\nother sections when they’re not—a technique that helps you automate many \\nprocesses.\\nYou’ll learn to accept input from users to make your programs interac -\\ntive, and to keep your programs running as long as the user wants. You’ll \\nexplore how to write functions that make parts of your program reusable,'),\n",

You’ll then extend this \\nconcept to more complicated behavior with classes, making fairly simple \\nprograms respond to a variety of situations. You’ll learn to write programs \\nthat handle common errors gracefully. After working through each of these \\nbasic concepts, you’ll write a number of increasingly complex programs \\nusing what you’ve learned. Finally, you’ll take your first step toward interme -\\ndiate programming by learning how to write tests for your code, so you can \\ndevelop your programs further without worrying about introducing bugs. \\nAll the information in Part I will prepare you for taking on larger, more \\ncomplex projects.\\nIn Part II, you’ll apply what you learned in Part I to three projects. You \\ncan do any or all of these projects, in whichever order works best for you. In \\nthe first project, in Chapters 12–14, you’ll create a Space Invaders–style shoot-\\ning game called Alien Invasion, which includes several increasingly difficult \\nlevels of game play. After you’ve completed this project, you should be well \\non your way to being able to develop your own 2D games. Even if you don’t \\naspire to become a game programmer, working through this project is an \\nenjoyable way to tie together much of what you’ll learn in Part I.\\nThe second project, in Chapters 15–17, introduces you to data visualiza -\\ntion. Data scientists use a variety of visualization techniques to help make \\nsense of the vast amount of information available to them. You’ll work with \\ndatasets that you generate through code, datasets that you download from \\nonline sources, and datasets your programs download automatically. After \\nyou’ve completed this project, you’ll be able to write programs that sift \\nthrough large datasets and make visual representations of many different \\nkinds of information.\\nIn the third project, in Chapters 18–20, you’ll build a small web appli-\\ncation called Learning Log. This project allows you to keep an organized \\njournal of information you’ve learned about a specific topic. You’ll be able \\nto keep separate logs for different topics and allow others to create an \\naccount and start their own journals. You’ll also learn how to deploy your \\nproject so anyone can access it online, from anywhere in the world.\\nOnline Resources\\nNo Starch Press has more information about this book available online at \\nhttps://nostarch.com/python-crash-course-3rd-edition.\\nI also maintain an extensive set of supplementary resources at https://\\nehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e. These resources include the following:\\nSetup instructions   The setup instructions online are identical to \\nwhat’s in the book, but they include active links you can click for all the \\ndifferent steps. If you’re having any setup issues, refer to this resource.\\nUpdates  Python, like all languages, is constantly evolving. I maintain \\na thorough set of updates, so if anything isn’t working, check here to \\nsee whether instructions have changed.'),\n",

Python is an incredibly \\nefficient language: your programs will do more in fewer lines of code than \\nmany other languages would require. Python’s syntax will also help you \\nwrite “clean” code. Your code will be easier to read, easier to debug, and \\neasier to extend and build upon, compared to other languages.\\nPeople use Python for many purposes: to make games, build web appli -\\ncations, solve business problems, and develop internal tools at all kinds of \\ninteresting companies. Python is also used heavily in scientific fields, for \\nacademic research and applied work.\\nOne of the most important reasons I continue to use Python is because \\nof the Python community, which includes an incredibly diverse and wel -\\ncoming group of people. Community is essential to programmers because \\nprogramming isn’t a solitary pursuit. Most of us, even the most experienced \\nprogrammers, need to ask advice from others who have already solved simi -\\nlar problems. Having a well-connected and supportive community is critical \\nto helping you solve problems, and the Python community is fully support -\\nive of people who are learning Python as their first programming language \\nor coming to Python with a background in other languages.\\nPython is a great language to learn, so let’s get started!'),\n",

As of this writing, the latest version is Python 3.11, \\nbut everything in this book should run on Python 3.9 or later. In this sec -\\ntion, we’ll find out if Python is already installed on your system and whether \\nyou need to install a newer version. Appendix A contains additional details \\nabout installing the latest version of Python on each major operating system \\nas well.\\nRunning Snippets of Python Code\\nYou can run Python’s interpreter in a terminal window, allowing you to try \\nbits of Python code without having to save and run an entire program.\\nThroughout this book, you’ll see code snippets that look like this:\\n>>> print(\"Hello Python interpreter!\")\\nHello Python interpreter!\\nThe three angle brackets (>>>) prompt, which we’ll refer to as a Python \\nprompt, indicates that you should be using the terminal window. The bold \\ntext is the code you should type in and then execute by pressing ENTER. \\nMost of the examples in this book are small, self-contained programs that \\nyou’ll run from your text editor rather than the terminal, because you’ll \\nwrite most of your code in the text editor. But sometimes, basic concepts \\nwill be shown in a series of snippets run through a Python terminal session \\nto demonstrate particular concepts more efficiently. When you see three \\nangle brackets in a code listing, you’re looking at code and output from \\na terminal session. We’ll try coding in the interpreter on your system in a \\nmoment.\\nWe’ll also use a text editor to create a simple program called Hello World! \\nthat has become a staple of learning to program. There’s a long-held tradi-\\ntion in the programming world that printing the message Hello world! to \\nthe screen as your first program in a new language will bring you good luck. \\nSuch a simple program serves a very real purpose. If it runs correctly on your \\nsystem, then any Python program you write should work as well.\\nAbout the VS Code Editor\\nVS Code is a powerful, professional-quality text editor that’s free and beginner-\\nfriendly. VS Code is great for both simple and complex projects, so if you \\nbecome comfortable using it while learning Python, you can continue using \\nit as you progress to larger and more complicated projects.

Any Python program you write should run \\non any modern computer that has Python installed. However, the methods \\nfor setting up Python on different operating systems vary slightly.\\nIn this section, you’ll learn how to set up Python on your system.

You’ll also learn \\nhow to use variables to represent data in your \\nprograms.\\nWhat Really Happens When You Run hello_world.py\\nLet’s take a closer look at what Python does when you run hello_world.py. As \\nit turns out, Python does a fair amount of work, even when it runs a simple \\nprogram:\\nhello_world.py print(\"Hello Python world!\")\\nWhen you run this code, you should see the following output:\\nHello Python world!'),\n",

Your editor then runs the file through the Python \\ninterpreter, which reads through the program and determines what each\\xa0word \\nin the program means. For example, when the interpreter sees the word \\nprint followed by parentheses, it prints to the screen whatever is inside the \\nparentheses.\\nAs you write your programs, your editor highlights different parts of \\nyour program in different ways. For example, it recognizes that print() is \\nthe name of a function and displays that word in one color. It recognizes \\nthat \"Hello Python world!\" is not Python code, and displays that phrase in a \\ndifferent color. This feature is called syntax highlighting and is quite useful \\nas you start to write your own programs.\\nVariables\\nLet’s try using a variable in hello_world.py. Add a new line at the beginning \\nof the file, and modify the second line:\\nhello_world.py message = \"Hello Python world!\"\\nprint(message)\\nRun this program to see what happens. You should see the same output \\nyou saw previously:\\nHello Python world!\\nWe’ve added a variable named message. Every variable is connected to a \\nvalue, which is the information associated with that variable. In this case \\nthe value is the \"Hello Python world!\" text.\\nAdding a variable makes a little more work for the Python interpreter. \\nWhen it processes the first line, it associates the variable message with the \\n\"Hello Python world!\"  text. When it reaches the second line, it prints the \\nvalue associated with message to the screen.\\nLet’s expand on this program by modifying hello_world.py to print a sec-\\nond message. Add a blank line to hello_world.py, and then add two new lines \\nof code:\\nmessage = \"Hello Python world!\"\\nprint(message)\\nmessage = \"Hello Python Crash Course world!\"\\nprint(message)\\nNow when you run hello_world.py, you should see two lines of output:\\nHello Python world!\\nHello Python Crash Course world!\\nYou can change the value of a variable in your program at any time, \\nand Python will always keep track of its current value.'),\n",

Breaking some of these rules will cause errors; other guide -\\nlines just help you write code that’s easier to read and understand. Be sure \\nto keep the following rules in mind when working with variables:\\n•\\t Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. \\nThey can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number. \\nFor instance, you can call a variable message_1 but not 1_message.\\n•\\t Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used \\nto separate words in variable names. For example, greeting_message works \\nbut greeting message will cause errors.\\n•\\t Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names. \\nFor example, do not use the word print as a variable name; Python \\nhas reserved it for a particular programmatic purpose. (See “Python \\nKeywords and Built-in Functions” on page 466 .)\\n•\\t Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, name is \\nbetter than n, student_name is better than s_n, and name_length is better \\nthan length_of_persons_name .\\n•\\t Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O \\nbecause they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0.\\nIt can take some practice to learn how to create good variable names, \\nespecially as your programs become more interesting and complicated. \\nAs you write more programs and start to read through other people’s code, \\nyou’ll get better at coming up with meaningful names.\\nNOTE  The Python variables you’re using at this point should be lowercase. You won’t get \\nerrors if you use uppercase letters, but uppercase letters in variable names have spe -\\ncial meanings that we’ll discuss in later chapters.\\nAvoiding Name Errors When Using Variables\\nEvery programmer makes mistakes, and most make mistakes every day. \\nAlthough good programmers might create errors, they also know how to \\nrespond to those errors efficiently. Let’s look at an error you’re likely to \\nmake early on and learn how to fix it.\\nWe’ll write some code that generates an error on purpose. Enter the fol-\\nlowing code, including the misspelled word mesage, which is shown in bold:\\nmessage = \"Hello Python Crash Course reader!\"\\nprint(mesage)\\nWhen an error occurs in your program, the Python interpreter does its \\nbest to help you figure out where the problem is. The interpreter provides \\na traceback when a program cannot run successfully. A traceback is a record \\nof where the interpreter ran into trouble when trying to execute your code.'),\n",

Did you mean: \\'message\\'?\\nThe output reports that an error occurs in line 2 of the file hello_world.py\\xa01.  \\nThe interpreter shows this line\\xa0 2 to help us spot the error quickly and \\ntells us what kind of error it found\\xa0 3. In this case it found a name error  \\nand reports that the variable being printed, mesage, has not been defined. \\nPython can’t identify the variable name provided. A name error usually \\nmeans we either forgot to set a variable’s value before using it, or we made a \\nspelling mistake when entering the variable’s name. If Python finds a vari -\\nable name that’s similar to the one it doesn’t recognize, it will ask if that’s \\nthe name you meant to use.\\nIn this example we omitted the letter s in the variable name message in \\nthe second line. The Python interpreter doesn’t spellcheck your code, but \\nit does ensure that variable names are spelled consistently. For example, \\nwatch what happens when we spell message incorrectly in the line that \\ndefines the variable:\\nmesage = \"Hello Python Crash Course reader!\"\\nprint(mesage)\\nIn this case, the program runs successfully!\\nHello Python Crash Course reader!\\nThe variable names match, so Python sees no issue. Programming lan -\\nguages are strict, but they disregard good and bad spelling. As a result, you \\ndon’t need to consider English spelling and grammar rules when you’re try-\\ning to create variable names and writing code.\\nMany programming errors are simple, single-character typos in one \\nline of a program. If you find yourself spending a long time searching for \\none of these errors, know that you’re in good company. Many experienced \\nand talented programmers spend hours hunting down these kinds of tiny \\nerrors. Try to laugh about it and move on, knowing it will happen frequently \\nthroughout your programming life.\\nVariables Are Labels\\nVariables are often described as boxes you can store values in. This idea can \\nbe helpful the first few times you use a variable, but it isn’t an accurate way \\nto describe how variables are represented internally in Python. It’s much \\nbetter to think of variables as labels that you can assign to values. You can \\nalso say that a variable references a certain value.'),\n",

At some point, you’ll see \\nunexpected behavior from a variable, and an accurate understanding of \\nhow variables work will help you identify what’s happening in your code.\\nNOTE  The best way to understand new programming concepts is to try using them in your \\nprograms. If you get stuck while working on an exercise in this book, try doing some -\\nthing else for a while. If you’re still stuck, review the relevant part of that chapter. If \\nyou still need help, see the suggestions in Appendix C.\\nTRY IT YOURSELF\\nWrite a separate program to accomplish each of these exercises.

Simple Messages: Assign a message to a variable, and print that message. \\nThen change the value of the variable to a new message, and print the new \\nmessage.\\nStrings\\nBecause most programs define and gather some sort of data and then do \\nsomething useful with it, it helps to classify different types of data. The first \\ndata type we’ll look at is the string. Strings are quite simple at first glance, \\nbut you can use them in many different ways.\\nA string is a series of characters. Anything inside quotes is considered \\na string in Python, and you can use single or double quotes around your \\nstrings like this:\\n\"This is a string.\"\\n\\'This is also a string.\\'\\nThis flexibility allows you to use quotes and apostrophes within your \\nstrings:\\n\\'I told my friend, \"Python is my favorite language!\"\\'\\n\"The language \\'Python\\' is named after Monty Python, not the snake.\"\\n\"One of Python\\'s strengths is its diverse and supportive community.\"\\nLet’s explore some of the ways you can use strings.'),\n",

Look at the following code, and try to determine what’s \\nhappening:\\nname.py name = \"ada lovelace\"\\nprint(name.title())\\nSave this file as name.py and then run it. You should see this output:\\nAda Lovelace\\nIn this example, the variable name refers to the lowercase string \"ada \\nlovelace\". The method title() appears after the variable in the print() call. A \\nmethod is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data. The dot\\xa0(.) \\nafter name in name.title() tells Python to make the title() method act on \\nthe variable name. Every method is followed by a set of parentheses, because \\nmethods often need additional information to do their work. That informa -\\ntion is provided inside the parentheses. The title() function doesn’t need \\nany additional information, so its parentheses are empty.\\nThe title() method changes each word to title case, where each word \\nbegins with a capital letter. This is useful because you’ll often want to think \\nof a name as a piece of information. For example, you might want your pro-\\ngram to recognize the input values Ada, ADA, and ada as the same name, and \\ndisplay all of them as Ada.\\nSeveral other useful methods are available for dealing with case as well. \\nFor example, you can change a string to all uppercase or all lowercase let-\\nters like this:\\nname = \"Ada Lovelace\"\\nprint(name.upper())\\nprint(name.lower())\\nThis will display the following:\\nADA LOVELACE\\nada lovelace\\nThe lower() method is particularly useful for storing data. You typi -\\ncally won’t want to trust the capitalization that your users provide, so you’ll \\nconvert strings to lowercase before storing them. Then when you want to \\ndisplay the information, you’ll use the case that makes the most sense for \\neach string.\\nUsing Variables in Strings\\nIn some situations, you’ll want to use a variable’s value inside a string. For \\nexample, you might want to use two variables to represent a first name and'),\n",

Put braces around the name or \\nnames of any variable you want to use inside the string. Python will replace \\neach variable with its value when the string is displayed.\\nThese strings are called f-strings . The f is for format , because Python \\nformats the string by replacing the name of any variable in braces with its \\nvalue. The output from the previous code is:\\nada lovelace\\nYou can do a lot with f-strings. For example, you can use f-strings to \\ncompose complete messages using the information associated with a vari -\\nable, as shown here:\\nfirst_name = \"ada\"\\nlast_name = \"lovelace\"\\nfull_name = f\"{first_name} {last_name}\"\\n1 print(f\"Hello, {full_name.title()}!\")\\nThe full name is used in a sentence that greets the user\\xa0 1, and the \\ntitle() method changes the name to title case. This code returns a simple \\nbut nicely formatted greeting:\\nHello, Ada Lovelace!\\nYou can also use f-strings to compose a message, and then assign the \\nentire message to a variable:\\nfirst_name = \"ada\"\\nlast_name = \"lovelace\"\\nfull_name = f\"{first_name} {last_name}\"\\n1 message = f\"Hello, {full_name.title()}!\"\\n2 print(message)\\nThis code displays the message Hello, Ada Lovelace!  as well, but by \\nassigning the message to a variable\\xa0 1 we make the final print() call much \\nsimpler\\xa02. \\nAdding Whitespace to Strings with Tabs or Newlines\\nIn programming, whitespace refers to any nonprinting characters, such as \\nspaces, tabs, and end-of-line symbols. You can use whitespace to organize \\nyour output so it’s easier for users to read.'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/Emailing Eric Matthes - Python Crash Course-No Starch Press (2023) (3).pdf', 'page': 59}, page_content='22\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Chapter 2\\nTo add a tab to your text, use the character combination \\\\t:\\n>>> print(\"Python\")\\nPython\\n>>> print(\"\\\\tPython\")\\n    Python\\nTo add a newline in a string, use the character combination \\\\n:\\n>>> print(\"Languages:\\\\nPython\\\\nC\\\\nJavaScript\")\\nLanguages:\\nPython\\nC\\nJavaScript\\nYou can also combine tabs and newlines in a single string. The string \\n\"\\\\n\\\\t\" tells Python to move to a new line, and start the next line with a tab. \\nThe following example shows how you can use a one-line string to generate \\nfour lines of output:\\n>>> print(\"Languages:\\\\n\\\\tPython\\\\n\\\\tC\\\\n\\\\tJavaScript\")\\nLanguages:\\n    Python\\n    C\\n    JavaScript\\nNewlines and tabs will be very useful in the next two chapters, when \\nyou start to produce many lines of output from just a few lines of code.\\nStripping Whitespace\\nExtra whitespace can be confusing in your programs. To programmers, \\n\\'python\\' and \\'python \\' look pretty much the same. But to a program, they \\nare two different strings. Python detects the extra space in \\'python \\' and \\nconsiders it significant unless you tell it otherwise.\\nIt’s important to think about whitespace, because often you’ll want to \\ncompare two strings to determine whether they are the same. For example, \\none important instance might involve checking people’s usernames when \\nthey log in to a website. Extra whitespace can be confusing in much sim -\\npler situations as well. Fortunately, Python makes it easy to eliminate extra \\nwhitespace from data that people enter.\\nPython can look for extra whitespace on the right and left sides of a \\nstring. To ensure that no whitespace exists at the right side of a string, use \\nthe rstrip() method:\\n1 >>> favorite_language = \\'python \\'\\n2 >>> favorite_language\\n\\'python \\'\\n3 >>> favorite_language.rstrip()\\n\\'python\\'\\n4 >>> favorite_language\\n\\'python \\''),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/Emailing Eric Matthes - Python Crash Course-No Starch Press (2023) (3).pdf', 'page': 60}, page_content=\"Variables and Simple Data Types \\xa0\\xa0\\xa023\\nThe value associated with favorite_language\\xa01 contains extra whitespace \\nat the end of the string. When you ask Python for this value in a termi -\\nnal session, you can see the space at the end of the value\\xa0 2. When the \\nrstrip() method acts on the variable favorite_language\\xa03, this extra space is \\nremoved. However, it is only removed temporarily. If you ask for the value \\nof favorite_language again, the string looks the same as when it was entered, \\nincluding the extra whitespace\\xa0 4.\\nTo remove the whitespace from the string permanently, you have to \\nassociate the stripped value with the variable name:\\n>>> favorite_language = 'python '\\n1 >>> favorite_language = favorite_language.rstrip()\\n>>> favorite_language\\n'python'\\nTo remove the whitespace from the string, you strip the whitespace \\nfrom the right side of the string and then associate this new value with \\nthe original variable\\xa0 1. Changing a variable’s value is done often in pro -\\ngramming. This is how a variable’s value can be updated as a program is \\nexecuted or in response to user input.\\nYou can also strip whitespace from the left side of a string using the \\nlstrip() method, or from both sides at once using strip():\\n1 >>> favorite_language = ' python '\\n2 >>> favorite_language.rstrip()\\n' python'\\n3 >>> favorite_language.lstrip()\\n'python '\\n4 >>> favorite_language.strip()\\n'python'\\nIn this example, we start with a value that has whitespace at the begin -\\nning and the end\\xa01. We then remove the extra space from the right side\\xa02, \\nfrom the left side\\xa03, and from both sides\\xa04. Experimenting with these strip-\\nping functions can help you become familiar with manipulating strings. In \\nthe real world, these stripping functions are used most often to clean up \\nuser input before it’s stored in a program.\\nRemoving Prefixes\\nWhen working with strings, another common task is to remove a prefix. \\nConsider a URL with the common prefix https://. We want to remove this \\nprefix, so we can focus on just the part of the URL that users need to enter \\ninto an address bar. Here’s how to do that:\\n>>> nostarch_url = 'https://nostarch.com'\\n>>> nostarch_url.removeprefix('https://')\\n'nostarch.com'\"),\n",

Inside the parentheses, enter the prefix you want to remove \\nfrom the original string.\\nLike the methods for removing whitespace, removeprefix() leaves the \\noriginal string unchanged. If you want to keep the new value with the pre -\\nfix removed, either reassign it to the original variable or assign it to a new \\nvariable:\\n>>> simple_url = nostarch_url.removeprefix(\\'https://\\')\\nWhen you see a URL in an address bar and the https:// part isn’t shown, \\nthe browser is probably using a method like removeprefix() behind the \\nscenes.\\nAvoiding Syntax Errors with Strings\\nOne kind of error that you might see with some regularity is a syntax error. \\nA syntax error occurs when Python doesn’t recognize a section of your pro -\\ngram as valid Python code. For example, if you use an apostrophe within \\nsingle quotes, you’ll produce an error. This happens because Python inter -\\nprets everything between the first single quote and the apostrophe as a \\nstring. It then tries to interpret the rest of the text as Python code, which \\ncauses errors.\\nHere’s how to use single and double quotes correctly. Save this program \\nas apostrophe.py and then run it:\\napostrophe.py message = \"One of Python\\'s strengths is its diverse community.\"\\nprint(message)\\nThe apostrophe appears inside a set of double quotes, so the Python \\ninterpreter has no trouble reading the string correctly:\\nOne of Python\\'s strengths is its diverse community.\\nHowever, if you use single quotes, Python can’t identify where the string \\nshould end:\\nmessage = \\'One of Python\\'s strengths is its diverse community.\\'\\nprint(message)\\nYou’ll see the following output:\\n  File \"apostrophe.py\", line 1\\n    message = \\'One of Python\\'s strengths is its diverse community.\\'\\n                                                                1 ^\\nSyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)\\nIn the output you can see that the error occurs right after the final single \\nquote\\xa01. This syntax error indicates that the interpreter doesn’t recognize'),\n",

Name Cases: Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and then print \\nthat person’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and title case.\\n2-5. Famous Quote: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the \\nquote and the name of its author. Your output should look something like the \\nfollowing, including the quotation marks:\\nAlbert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never \\ntried anything new.”\\n2-6. Famous Quote 2: Repeat Exercise 2-5, but this time, represent the famous \\nperson’s name using a variable called famous_person.

Python treats numbers in several different ways, depending on how \\nthey’re being used. Let’s first look at how Python manages integers, because \\nthey’re the simplest to work with.\\nIntegers\\nYou can add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide (/) integers in Python.\\n>>> 2 + 3\\n5\\n>>> 3 - 2\\n1\\n>>> 2 * 3\\n6\\n>>> 3 / 2\\n1.5\\nIn a terminal session, Python simply returns the result of the operation. \\nPython uses two multiplication symbols to represent exponents:\\n>>> 3 ** 2\\n9\\n>>> 3 ** 3\\n27\\n>>> 10 ** 6\\n1000000\\nPython supports the order of operations too, so you can use multiple \\noperations in one expression. You can also use parentheses to modify the \\norder of operations so Python can evaluate your expression in the order \\nyou specify. For example:\\n>>> 2 + 3*4\\n14\\n>>> (2 + 3) * 4\\n20\\nThe spacing in these examples has no effect on how Python evaluates \\nthe expressions; it simply helps you more quickly spot the operations that \\nhave priority when you’re reading through the code.\\nFloats\\nPython calls any number with a decimal point a float. This term is used in \\nmost programming languages, and it refers to the fact that a decimal point'),\n",

Every programming language must \\nbe carefully designed to properly manage decimal numbers so numbers \\nbehave appropriately, no matter where the decimal point appears.\\nFor the most part, you can use floats without worrying about how they \\nbehave. Simply enter the numbers you want to use, and Python will most \\nlikely do what you expect:\\n>>> 0.1 + 0.1\\n0.2\\n>>> 0.2 + 0.2\\n0.4\\n>>> 2 * 0.1\\n0.2\\n>>> 2 * 0.2\\n0.4\\nHowever, be aware that you can sometimes get an arbitrary number of \\ndecimal places in your answer:\\n>>> 0.2 + 0.1\\n0.30000000000000004\\n>>> 3 * 0.1\\n0.30000000000000004\\nThis happens in all languages and is of little concern. Python tries to \\nfind a way to represent the result as precisely as possible, which is sometimes \\ndifficult given how computers have to represent numbers internally. Just \\nignore the extra decimal places for now; you’ll learn ways to deal with the \\nextra places when you need to in the projects in Part II .\\nIntegers and Floats\\nWhen you divide any two numbers, even if they are integers that result in a \\nwhole number, you’ll always get a float:\\n>>> 4/2\\n2.0\\nIf you mix an integer and a float in any other operation, you’ll get a \\nfloat as well:\\n>>> 1 + 2.0\\n3.0\\n>>> 2 * 3.0\\n6.0\\n>>> 3.0 ** 2\\n9.0'),\n",

To Python, 1000 is the same as 1_000, which is the same as 10_00. This \\nfeature works for both integers and floats.\\nMultiple Assignment\\nYou can assign values to more than one variable using just a single line of \\ncode. This can help shorten your programs and make them easier to read; \\nyou’ll use this technique most often when initializing a set of numbers.\\nFor example, here’s how you can initialize the variables x, y, and z to zero:\\n>>> x, y, z = 0, 0, 0\\nYou need to separate the variable names with commas, and do the same \\nwith the values, and Python will assign each value to its respective variable. \\nAs long as the number of values matches the number of variables, Python \\nwill match them up correctly.\\nConstants\\nA constant is a variable whose value stays the same throughout the life of a \\nprogram. Python doesn’t have built-in constant types, but Python program -\\nmers use all capital letters to indicate a variable should be treated as a con-\\nstant and never be changed:\\nMAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000\\nWhen you want to treat a variable as a constant in your code, write the \\nname of the variable in all capital letters.'),\n",

A comment allows you to write notes in your spoken \\nlanguage, within your programs.\\nHow Do You Write Comments?\\nIn Python, the hash mark (#) indicates a comment. Anything following a \\nhash mark in your code is ignored by the Python interpreter. For example:\\ncomment.py # Say hello to everyone.\\nprint(\"Hello Python people!\")\\nPython ignores the first line and executes the second line.\\nHello Python people!\\nWhat Kinds of Comments Should You Write?\\nThe main reason to write comments is to explain what your code is sup -\\nposed to do and how you are making it work. When you’re in the middle \\nof working on a project, you understand how all of the pieces fit together. \\nBut when you return to a project after some time away, you’ll likely have'),\n",

You can always study your code for a while \\nand figure out how segments were supposed to work, but writing good com -\\nments can save you time by summarizing your overall approach clearly.\\nIf you want to become a professional programmer or collaborate with \\nother programmers, you should write meaningful comments. Today, most \\nsoftware is written collaboratively, whether by a group of employees at one \\ncompany or a group of people working together on an open source project. \\nSkilled programmers expect to see comments in code, so it’s best to start \\nadding descriptive comments to your programs now. Writing clear, concise \\ncomments in your code is one of the most beneficial habits you can form as \\na new programmer.\\nWhen you’re deciding whether to write a comment, ask yourself if you \\nhad to consider several approaches before coming up with a reasonable way \\nto make something work; if so, write a comment about your solution. It’s \\nmuch easier to delete extra comments later than to go back and write com -\\nments for a sparsely commented program. From now on, I’ll use comments \\nin examples throughout this book to help explain sections of code.\\nTRY IT YOURSELF\\n2-11. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and \\nadd at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write \\nbecause your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the \\ncurrent date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing \\nwhat the program does.\\nThe Zen of Python\\nExperienced Python programmers will encourage you to avoid complexity \\nand aim for simplicity whenever possible. The Python community’s philoso -\\nphy is contained in “The Zen of Python” by Tim Peters.

Here’s a simple example of a list that \\ncontains a few kinds of bicycles:\\nbicycles.py bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']\\nprint(bicycles)\\nIf you ask Python to print a list, Python returns its representation of the \\nlist, including the square brackets:\\n['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']\\nBecause this isn’t the output you want your users to see, let’s learn how \\nto access the individual items in a list.\\nAccessing Elements in a List\\nLists are ordered collections, so you can access any element in a list by \\ntelling Python the position, or  index, of the item desired. To access an ele-\\nment in a list, write the name of the list followed by the index of the item \\nenclosed in square brackets.\\nFor example, let’s pull out the first bicycle in the list bicycles:\\nbicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']\\nprint(bicycles[0])\\nWhen we ask for a single item from a list, Python returns just that ele -\\nment without square brackets:\\ntrek\\nThis is the result you want your users to see: clean, neatly formatted \\noutput.\\nYou can also use the string methods from Chapter\\xa02 on any element in \\nthis list. For example, you can format the element 'trek' to look more pre-\\nsentable by using the title() method:\\nbicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']\\nprint(bicycles[0].title())\\nThis example produces the same output as the preceding example, \\nexcept 'Trek' is capitalized.\\nIndex Positions Start at 0, Not 1\\nPython considers the first item in a list to be at position 0, not position 1. \\nThis is true of most programming languages, and the reason has to do with\"),\n",

If you’re receiving \\nunexpected results, ask yourself if you’re making a simple but common off-\\nby-one error.\\nThe second item in a list has an index of 1. Using this counting sys -\\ntem, you can get any element you want from a list by subtracting one from \\nits position in the list. For instance, to access the fourth item in a list, you \\nrequest the item at index 3.\\nThe following asks for the bicycles at index 1 and index 3:\\nbicycles = [\\'trek\\', \\'cannondale\\', \\'redline\\', \\'specialized\\']\\nprint(bicycles[1])\\nprint(bicycles[3])\\nThis code returns the second and fourth bicycles in the list:\\ncannondale\\nspecialized\\nPython has a special syntax for accessing the last element in a list. If you \\nask for the item at index -1, Python always returns the last item in the list:\\nbicycles = [\\'trek\\', \\'cannondale\\', \\'redline\\', \\'specialized\\']\\nprint(bicycles[-1])\\nThis code returns the value \\'specialized\\'. This syntax is quite useful, \\nbecause you’ll often want to access the last items in a list without knowing \\nexactly how long the list is. This convention extends to other negative index \\nvalues as well. The index -2 returns the second item from the end of the list, \\nthe index -3 returns the third item from the end, and so forth.\\nUsing Individual Values from a List\\nYou can use individual values from a list just as you would any other vari -\\nable. For example, you can use f-strings to create a message based on a \\nvalue from a list.\\nLet’s try pulling the first bicycle from the list and composing a message \\nusing that value:\\nbicycles = [\\'trek\\', \\'cannondale\\', \\'redline\\', \\'specialized\\']\\nmessage = f\"My first bicycle was a {bicycles[0].title()}.\"\\nprint(message)\\nWe build a sentence using the value at bicycles[0] and assign it to the \\nvariable message.

Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a \\nmotorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list \\nto print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a \\nHonda motorcycle.”\\nModifying, Adding, and Removing Elements\\nMost lists you create will be dynamic, meaning you’ll build a list and then \\nadd and remove elements from it as your program runs its course. For \\nexample, you might create a game in which a player has to shoot aliens out \\nof the sky. You could store the initial set of aliens in a list and then remove \\nan alien from the list each time one is shot down. Each time a new alien \\nappears on the screen, you add it to the list. Your list of aliens will increase \\nand decrease in length throughout the course of the game.\\nModifying Elements in a List\\nThe syntax for modifying an element is similar to the syntax for accessing \\nan element in a list. To change an element, use the name of the list followed \\nby the index of the element you want to change, and then provide the new \\nvalue you want that item to have.\\nFor example, say we have a list of motorcycles and the first item in the \\nlist is 'honda'. We can change the value of this first item after the list has \\nbeen created:\\nmotorcycles.py motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\\nprint(motorcycles)\\nmotorcycles[0] = 'ducati'\\nprint(motorcycles)\"),\n",

The output shows \\nthat the first item has been changed, while the rest of the list stays the same:\\n['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\\n['ducati', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\\nYou can change the value of any item in a list, not just the first item.\\nAdding Elements to a List\\nYou might want to add a new element to a list for many reasons. For  \\nexample, you might want to make new aliens appear in a game, add new  \\ndata to a visualization, or add new registered users to a website you’ve \\nbuilt. Python provides several ways to add new data to existing lists.\\nAppending Elements to the End of a List\\nThe simplest way to add a new element to a list is to append the item to the \\nlist. When you append an item to a list, the new element is added to the end \\nof the list. Using the same list we had in the previous example, we’ll add the \\nnew element 'ducati' to the end of the list:\\nmotorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\\nprint(motorcycles)\\nmotorcycles.append('ducati')\\nprint(motorcycles)\\nHere the append() method adds 'ducati' to the end of the list, without \\naffecting any of the other elements in the list:\\n['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\\n['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati']\\nThe append() method makes it easy to build lists dynamically. For example, \\nyou can start with an empty list and then add items to the list using a series \\nof append() calls. Using an empty list, let’s add the elements 'honda', 'yamaha', \\nand 'suzuki' to the list:\\nmotorcycles = []\\nmotorcycles.append('honda')\\nmotorcycles.append('yamaha')\\nmotorcycles.append('suzuki')\\nprint(motorcycles)\\nThe resulting list looks exactly the same as the lists in the previous \\nexamples:\\n['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\"),\n",

To put your users in control, start by defining an empty list that \\nwill hold the users’ values. Then append each new value provided to the list \\nyou just created.\\nInserting Elements into a List\\nYou can add a new element at any position in your list by using the insert() \\nmethod. You do this by specifying the index of the new element and the \\nvalue of the new item:\\nmotorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\\nmotorcycles.insert(0, 'ducati')\\nprint(motorcycles)\\nIn this example, we insert the value 'ducati' at the beginning of the \\nlist. The insert() method opens a space at position 0 and stores the value \\n'ducati' at that location:\\n['ducati', 'honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\\nThis operation shifts every other value in the list one position to the \\nright.\\nRemoving Elements from a List\\nOften, you’ll want to remove an item or a set of items from a list. For example, \\nwhen a player shoots down an alien from the sky, you’ll most likely want to \\nremove it from the list of active aliens. Or when a user decides to cancel \\ntheir account on a web application you created, you’ll want to remove that \\nuser from the list of active users. You can remove an item according to its \\nposition in the list or according to its value.\\nRemoving an Item Using the del Statement\\nIf you know the position of the item you want to remove from a list, you can \\nuse the del statement:\\nmotorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\\nprint(motorcycles)\\ndel motorcycles[0]\\nprint(motorcycles)\\nHere we use the del statement to remove the first item, 'honda', from the \\nlist of motorcycles:\\n['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\\n['yamaha', 'suzuki']\"),\n",

For example, here’s how to remove the second \\nitem, 'yamaha', from the list:\\nmotorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\\nprint(motorcycles)\\ndel motorcycles[1]\\nprint(motorcycles)\\nThe second motorcycle is deleted from the list:\\n['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\\n['honda', 'suzuki']\\nIn both examples, you can no longer access the value that was removed \\nfrom the list after the del statement is used.\\nRemoving an Item Using the pop() Method\\nSometimes you’ll want to use the value of an item after you remove it from a \\nlist. For example, you might want to get the x and y position of an alien that \\nwas just shot down, so you can draw an explosion at that position. In a web \\napplication, you might want to remove a user from a list of active members \\nand then add that user to a list of inactive members.\\nThe pop() method removes the last item in a list, but it lets you work \\nwith that item after removing it.

Then we pop a \\nvalue from the list, and assign that value to the variable popped_motorcycle\\xa02. \\nWe print the list\\xa0 3 to show that a value has been removed from the list. \\nThen we print the popped value\\xa04 to prove that we still have access to the \\nvalue that was removed.\\nThe output shows that the value 'suzuki' was removed from the end of \\nthe list and is now assigned to the variable popped_motorcycle:\\n['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\\n['honda', 'yamaha']\\nsuzuki\"),\n",

The output is a simple sentence describing \\nthe first motorcycle I ever owned:\\nThe first motorcycle I owned was a Honda.\\nRemember that each time you use pop(), the item you work with is no \\nlonger stored in the list.\\nIf you’re unsure whether to use the del statement or the pop() method, \\nhere’s a simple way to decide: when you want to delete an item from a list \\nand not use that item in any way, use the del statement; if you want to use an \\nitem as you remove it, use the pop() method.\\nRemoving an Item by Value\\nSometimes you won’t know the position of the value you want to remove \\nfrom a list. If you only know the value of the item you want to remove, you \\ncan use the remove() method.\\nFor example, say we want to remove the value \\'ducati\\' from the list of \\nmotorcycles:\\nmotorcycles = [\\'honda\\', \\'yamaha\\', \\'suzuki\\', \\'ducati\\']\\nprint(motorcycles)\\nmotorcycles.remove(\\'ducati\\')\\nprint(motorcycles)'),\n",

Let’s remove the value \\'ducati\\' and print a reason for \\nremoving it from the list:\\n1 motorcycles = [\\'honda\\', \\'yamaha\\', \\'suzuki\\', \\'ducati\\']\\nprint(motorcycles)\\n2 too_expensive = \\'ducati\\'\\n3 motorcycles.remove(too_expensive)\\nprint(motorcycles)\\n4 print(f\"\\\\nA {too_expensive.title()} is too expensive for me.\")\\nAfter defining the list\\xa0 1, we assign the value \\'ducati\\' to a variable \\ncalled too_expensive\\xa02.

Python provides a number of different ways to \\norganize your lists, depending on the situation.\\nSorting a List Permanently with the sort() Method\\nPython’s sort() method makes it relatively easy to sort a list. Imagine we \\nhave a list of cars and want to change the order of the list to store them \\nalphabetically. To keep the task simple, let’s assume that all the values in \\nthe list are lowercase:\\ncars.py cars = [\\'bmw\\', \\'audi\\', \\'toyota\\', \\'subaru\\']\\ncars.sort()\\nprint(cars)\\nThe sort() method changes the order of the list permanently. The cars \\nare now in alphabetical order, and we can never revert to the original order:\\n[\\'audi\\', \\'bmw\\', \\'subaru\\', \\'toyota\\']\\nYou can also sort this list in reverse-alphabetical order by passing the \\nargument reverse=True to the sort() method. The following example sorts \\nthe list of cars in reverse-alphabetical order:\\ncars = [\\'bmw\\', \\'audi\\', \\'toyota\\', \\'subaru\\']\\ncars.sort(reverse=True)\\nprint(cars)\\nAgain, the order of the list is permanently changed:\\n[\\'toyota\\', \\'subaru\\', \\'bmw\\', \\'audi\\']\\nSorting a List Temporarily with the sorted() Function\\nTo maintain the original order of a list but present it in a sorted order, you \\ncan use the sorted() function. The sorted() function lets you display your list \\nin a particular order, but doesn’t affect the actual order of the list.\\nLet’s try this function on the list of cars.\\ncars = [\\'bmw\\', \\'audi\\', \\'toyota\\', \\'subaru\\']\\n1 print(\"Here is the original list:\")\\nprint(cars)\\n2 print(\"\\\\nHere is the sorted list:\")\\nprint(sorted(cars))\\n3 print(\"\\\\nHere is the original list again:\")\\nprint(cars)'),\n",

The sorted() function can also accept a reverse=True \\nargument if you want to display a list in reverse-alphabetical order.\\nNOTE  Sorting a list alphabetically is a bit more complicated when all the values are not in \\nlowercase. There are several ways to interpret capital letters when determining a sort \\norder, and specifying the exact order can be more complex than we want to deal with \\nat this time. However, most approaches to sorting will build directly on what you \\nlearned in this section.\\nPrinting a List in Reverse Order\\nTo reverse the original order of a list, you can use the reverse() method. If \\nwe originally stored the list of cars in chronological order according to when \\nwe owned them, we could easily rearrange the list into reverse-chronological \\norder:\\ncars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']\\nprint(cars)\\ncars.reverse()\\nprint(cars)\\nNotice that reverse() doesn’t sort backward alphabetically; it simply \\nreverses the order of the list:\\n['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']\\n['subaru', 'toyota', 'audi', 'bmw']\\nThe reverse() method changes the order of a list permanently, but you \\ncan revert to the original order anytime by applying reverse() to the same \\nlist a second time.\\nFinding the Length of a List\\nYou can quickly find the length of a list by using the len() function. The list \\nin this example has four items, so its length is 4:\\n>>> cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']\\n>>> len(cars)\\n4\"),\n",

Let’s say you have a list with three items, and you ask \\nfor the fourth item:\\nmotorcycles.py motorcycles = [\\'honda\\', \\'yamaha\\', \\'suzuki\\']\\nprint(motorcycles[3])\\nThis example results in an index error :\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"motorcycles.py\", line 2, in <module>\\n    print(motorcycles[3])\\n          ~~~~~~~~~~~^^^\\nIndexError: list index out of range\\nPython attempts to give you the item at index 3. But when it searches \\nthe list, no item in motorcycles has an index of 3. Because of the off-by-one \\nnature of indexing in lists, this error is typical. People think the third item \\nis item number 3, because they start counting at 1. But in Python the third \\nitem is number 2, because it starts indexing at 0.\\nAn index error means Python can’t find an item at the index you \\nrequested. If an index error occurs in your program, try adjusting the \\nindex you’re asking for by one. Then run the program again to see if the \\nresults are correct.\\nKeep in mind that whenever you want to access the last item in a list, \\nyou should use the index -1. This will always work, even if your list has \\nchanged size since the last time you accessed it:\\nmotorcycles = [\\'honda\\', \\'yamaha\\', \\'suzuki\\']\\nprint(motorcycles[-1])\\nThe index -1 always returns the last item in a list, in this case the value \\n\\'suzuki\\':\\nsuzuki\\nThe only time this approach will cause an error is when you request the \\nlast item from an empty list:\\nmotorcycles = []\\nprint(motorcycles[-1])\\nNo items are in motorcycles, so Python returns another index error:\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"motorcyles.py\", line 3, in <module>\\n    print(motorcycles[-1])\\n          ~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^\\nIndexError: list index out of range'),\n",

When you want to do the same action with every item in a list, you \\ncan use Python’s for loop.\\nSay we have a list of magicians’ names, and we want to print out each \\nname in the list. We could do this by retrieving each name from the list indi-\\nvidually, but this approach could cause several problems. For one, it would \\nbe repetitive to do this with a long list of names. Also, we’d have to change \\nour code each time the list’s length changed. Using a for loop avoids both of \\nthese issues by letting Python manage these issues internally.\\nLet’s use a for loop to print out each name in a list of magicians:\\nmagicians.py magicians = ['alice', 'david', 'carolina']\\nfor magician in magicians:\\n    print(magician)\\nWe begin by defining a list, just as we did in Chapter\\xa03. Then we define \\na for loop. This line tells Python to pull a name from the list magicians, \\nand associate it with the variable magician. Next, we tell Python to print the \\nname that’s just been assigned to magician. Python then repeats these last \\ntwo lines, once for each name in the list. It might help to read this code as \\n“For every magician in the list of magicians, print the magician’s name.” \\nThe output is a simple printout of each name in the list:\\nalice\\ndavid\\ncarolina\\nA Closer Look at Looping\\nLooping is important because it’s one of the most common ways a computer \\nautomates repetitive tasks. For example, in a simple loop like we used in \\nmagicians.py, Python initially reads the first line of the loop:\\nfor magician in magicians:\\nThis line tells Python to retrieve the first value from the list magicians \\nand associate it with the variable magician. This first value is 'alice'. Python \\nthen reads the next line:\\n    print(magician)\\nPython prints the current value of magician, which is still 'alice'. Because \\nthe list contains more values, Python returns to the first line of the loop:\\nfor magician in magicians:\\nPython retrieves the next name in the list, 'david', and associates that \\nvalue with the variable magician. Python then executes the line:\\n    print(magician)\"),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/Emailing Eric Matthes - Python Crash Course-No Starch Press (2023) (3).pdf', 'page': 88}, page_content='Working with Lists \\xa0\\xa0\\xa051\\nPython prints the current value of magician again, which is now \\'david\\'. \\nPython repeats the entire loop once more with the last value in the list, \\n\\'carolina\\'. Because no more values are in the list, Python moves on to the \\nnext line in the program. In this case nothing comes after the for loop, so \\nthe program ends.\\nWhen you’re using loops for the first time, keep in mind that the set of \\nsteps is repeated once for each item in the list, no matter how many items \\nare in the list. If you have a million items in your list, Python repeats these \\nsteps a million times—and usually very quickly.\\nAlso keep in mind when writing your own for loops that you can choose \\nany name you want for the temporary variable that will be associated with \\neach value in the list. However, it’s helpful to choose a meaningful name \\nthat represents a single item from the list. For example, here’s a good way to \\nstart a for loop for a list of cats, a list of dogs, and a general list of items:\\nfor cat in cats:\\nfor dog in dogs:\\nfor item in list_of_items:\\nThese naming conventions can help you follow the action being done \\non each item within a for loop. Using singular and plural names can help \\nyou identify whether a section of code is working with a single element from \\nthe list or the entire list.\\nDoing More Work Within a for Loop\\nYou can do just about anything with each item in a for loop. Let’s build on \\nthe previous example by printing a message to each magician, telling them \\nthat they performed a great trick:\\nmagicians.py magicians = [\\'alice\\', \\'david\\', \\'carolina\\']\\nfor magician in magicians:\\n    print(f\"{magician.title()}, that was a great trick!\")\\nThe only difference in this code is where we compose a message to each \\nmagician, starting with that magician’s name. The first time through the \\nloop the value of magician is \\'alice\\', so Python starts the first message with the \\nname \\'Alice\\'. The second time through, the message will begin with \\'David\\', \\nand the third time through, the message will begin with \\'Carolina\\'.\\nThe output shows a personalized message for each magician in the list:\\nAlice, that was a great trick!\\nDavid, that was a great trick!\\nCarolina, that was a great trick!\\nYou can also write as many lines of code as you like in the for loop. Every \\nindented line following the line for magician in magicians is considered inside \\nthe loop , and each indented line is executed once for each value in the list. \\nTherefore, you can do as much work as you like with each value in the list.'),\n",

The newline ( \"\\\\n\") in the second \\nprint() call inserts a blank line after each pass through the loop. This cre -\\nates a set of messages that are neatly grouped for each person in the list:\\nAlice, that was a great trick!\\nI can\\'t wait to see your next trick, Alice.\\nDavid, that was a great trick!\\nI can\\'t wait to see your next trick, David.\\nCarolina, that was a great trick!\\nI can\\'t wait to see your next trick, Carolina.\\nYou can use as many lines as you like in your for loops. In practice, \\nyou’ll often find it useful to do a number of different operations with each \\nitem in a list when you use a for loop.\\nDoing Something After a for Loop\\nWhat happens once a for loop has finished executing? Usually, you’ll want \\nto summarize a block of output or move on to other work that your pro -\\ngram must accomplish.\\nAny lines of code after the for loop that are not indented are executed \\nonce without repetition. Let’s write a thank you to the group of magicians \\nas a whole, thanking them for putting on an excellent show. To display this \\ngroup message after all of the individual messages have been printed, we \\nplace the thank you message after the for loop, without indentation:\\nmagicians = [\\'alice\\', \\'david\\', \\'carolina\\']\\nfor magician in magicians:\\n    print(f\"{magician.title()}, that was a great trick!\")\\n    print(f\"I can\\'t wait to see your next trick, {magician.title()}.\\\\n\")\\nprint(\"Thank you, everyone. That was a great magic show!\")\\nThe first two calls to print() are repeated once for each magician in the \\nlist, as you saw earlier.

That was a great magic show!\\nWhen you’re processing data using a for loop, you’ll find that this is a \\ngood way to summarize an operation that was performed on an entire data -\\nset. For example, you might use a for loop to initialize a game by running \\nthrough a list of characters and displaying each character on the screen. \\nYou might then write some additional code after this loop that displays a \\nPlay Now button after all the characters have been drawn to the screen.\\nAvoiding Indentation Errors\\nPython uses indentation to determine how a line, or group of lines, is related \\nto the rest of the program. In the previous examples, the lines that printed \\nmessages to individual magicians were part of the for loop because they \\nwere indented. Python’s use of indentation makes code very easy to read. \\nBasically, it uses whitespace to force you to write neatly formatted code with \\na clear visual structure. In longer Python programs, you’ll notice blocks of \\ncode indented at a few different levels. These indentation levels help you \\ngain a general sense of the overall program’s organization.\\nAs you begin to write code that relies on proper indentation, you’ll \\nneed to watch for a few common indentation errors . For example, people \\nsometimes indent lines of code that don’t need to be indented or forget \\nto indent lines that need to be indented. Seeing examples of these errors \\nnow will help you avoid them in the future and correct them when they do \\nappear in your own programs.\\nLet’s examine some of the more common indentation errors.\\nForgetting to Indent\\nAlways indent the line after the for statement in a loop. If you forget, Python \\nwill remind you:\\nmagicians.py magicians = [\\'alice\\', \\'david\\', \\'carolina\\']\\nfor magician in magicians:\\n1 print(magician)\\nThe call to print()\\xa01 should be indented, but it’s not. When Python \\nexpects an indented block and doesn’t find one, it lets you know which line \\nit had a problem with:\\n  File \"magicians.py\", line 3\\n    print(magician)\\n    ^\\nIndentationError: expected an indented block after \\'for\\' statement on line 2'),\n",

This can happen when you’re trying to do several tasks  \\nin a loop and you forget to indent some of its lines.\\nFor example, this is what happens when we forget to indent the second \\nline in the loop that tells each magician we’re looking forward to their next \\ntrick:\\nmagicians = [\\'alice\\', \\'david\\', \\'carolina\\']\\nfor magician in magicians:\\n    print(f\"{magician.title()}, that was a great trick!\")\\n1 print(f\"I can\\'t wait to see your next trick, {magician.title()}.\\\\n\")\\nThe second call to print()\\xa01 is supposed to be indented, but because \\nPython finds at least one indented line after the for statement, it doesn’t \\nreport an error. As a result, the first print() call is executed once for each \\nname in the list because it is indented.

In the programs you’re writing at this \\npoint, the only lines you should indent are the actions you want to repeat \\nfor each item in a for loop.\\nIndenting Unnecessarily After the Loop\\nIf you accidentally indent code that should run after a loop has finished, \\nthat code will be repeated once for each item in the list. Sometimes this \\nprompts Python to report an error, but often this will result in a logical \\nerror.\\nFor example, let’s see what happens when we accidentally indent the \\nline that thanked the magicians as a group for putting on a good show:\\nmagicians.py magicians = [\\'alice\\', \\'david\\', \\'carolina\\']\\nfor magician in magicians:\\n    print(f\"{magician.title()}, that was a great trick!\")\\n    print(f\"I can\\'t wait to see your next trick, {magician.title()}.\\\\n\")\\n1     print(\"Thank you everyone, that was a great magic show!\")\\nBecause the last line\\xa0 1 is indented, it’s printed once for each person in \\nthe list:\\nAlice, that was a great trick!\\nI can\\'t wait to see your next trick, Alice.\\nThank you everyone, that was a great magic show!\\nDavid, that was a great trick!\\nI can\\'t wait to see your next trick, David.\\nThank you everyone, that was a great magic show!\\nCarolina, that was a great trick!\\nI can\\'t wait to see your next trick, Carolina.\\nThank you everyone, that was a great magic show!\\nThis is another logical error, similar to the one in “Forgetting to Indent \\nAdditional Lines” on page 54. Because Python doesn’t know what you’re \\ntrying to accomplish with your code, it will run all code that is written in \\nvalid syntax. If an action is repeated many times when it should be executed \\nonly once, you probably need to unindent the code for that action.\\nForgetting the Colon\\nThe colon at the end of a for statement tells Python to interpret the next \\nline as the start of a loop.\\nmagicians = [\\'alice\\', \\'david\\', \\'carolina\\']\\n1 for magician in magicians\\n    print(magician)'),\n",

In data visualizations, you’ll \\nalmost always work with sets of numbers, such as temperatures, distances, \\npopulation sizes, or latitude and longitude values, among other types of \\nnumerical sets.\\nLists are ideal for storing sets of numbers, and Python provides a variety \\nof tools to help you work efficiently with lists of numbers. Once you under-\\nstand how to use these tools effectively, your code will work well even when \\nyour lists contain millions of items.\\nUsing the range() Function\\nPython’s range() function makes it easy to generate a series of numbers.  \\nFor example, you can use the range() function to print a series of numbers \\nlike this:\\nfirst_numbers.py for value in range(1, 5):\\n    print(value)\\nAlthough this code looks like it should print the numbers from 1 to 5, it \\ndoesn’t print the number 5:\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\nIn this example, range() prints only the numbers 1 through 4. This is \\nanother result of the off-by-one behavior you’ll see often in programming \\nlanguages. The range() function causes Python to start counting at the first \\nvalue you give it, and it stops when it reaches the second value you provide. \\nBecause it stops at that second value, the output never contains the end \\nvalue, which would have been 5 in this case.\\nTo print the numbers from 1 to 5, you would use range(1, 6):\\nfor value in range(1, 6):\\n    print(value)\\nThis time the output starts at 1 and ends at 5:\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\nIf your output is different from what you expect when you’re using \\nrange(), try adjusting your end value by 1.\\nYou can also pass range() only one argument, and it will start the \\nsequence of numbers at 0. For example, range(6) would return the numbers \\nfrom 0 through 5.'),\n",

When you wrap list() around a \\ncall to the range() function, the output will be a list of numbers.\\nIn the example in the previous section, we simply printed out a series of \\nnumbers. We can use list() to convert that same set of numbers into a list:\\nnumbers = list(range(1, 6))\\nprint(numbers)\\nThis is the result:\\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\\nWe can also use the range() function to tell Python to skip numbers in a \\ngiven range. If you pass a third argument to range(), Python uses that value \\nas a step size when generating numbers.\\nFor example, here’s how to list the even numbers between 1 and 10:\\neven_numbers.py even_numbers = list(range(2, 11, 2))\\nprint(even_numbers)\\nIn this example, the range() function starts with the value 2 and then \\nadds 2 to that value. It adds 2 repeatedly until it reaches or passes the end \\nvalue, 11, and produces this result:\\n[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\\nYou can create almost any set of numbers you want to using the range() \\nfunction. For example, consider how you might make a list of the first 10 \\nsquare numbers (that is, the square of each integer from 1 through 10). In \\nPython, two asterisks ( **) represent exponents. Here’s how you might put \\nthe first 10 square numbers into a list:\\nsquare \\n_numbers.py\\nsquares = []\\nfor value in range(1, 11):\\n1     square = value ** 2\\n2     squares.append(square)\\nprint(squares)\\nWe start with an empty list called squares. Then, we tell Python to loop \\nthrough each value from 1 to 10 using the range() function. Inside the loop, \\nthe current value is raised to the second power and assigned to the variable \\nsquare\\xa01. Each new value of square is then appended to the list squares\\xa02. \\nFinally, when the loop has finished running, the list of squares is printed:\\n[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/Emailing Eric Matthes - Python Crash Course-No Starch Press (2023) (3).pdf', 'page': 96}, page_content='Working with Lists \\xa0\\xa0\\xa059\\nTo write this code more concisely, omit the temporary variable square \\nand append each new value directly to the list:\\nsquares = []\\nfor value in range(1,11):\\n    squares.append(value**2)\\nprint(squares)\\nThis line does the same work as the lines inside the for loop in the pre-\\nvious listing. Each value in the loop is raised to the second power and then \\nimmediately appended to the list of squares.\\nYou can use either of these approaches when you’re making more com-\\nplex lists. Sometimes using a temporary variable makes your code easier to \\nread; other times it makes the code unnecessarily long. Focus first on writ -\\ning code that you understand clearly, and does what you want it to do. Then \\nlook for more efficient approaches as you review your code.\\nSimple Statistics with a List of Numbers\\nA few Python functions are helpful when working with lists of numbers. For \\nexample, you can easily find the minimum, maximum, and sum of a list of \\nnumbers:\\n>>> digits = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]\\n>>> min(digits)\\n0\\n>>> max(digits)\\n9\\n>>> sum(digits)\\n45\\nNOTE  The examples in this section use short lists of numbers that fit easily on the page. They \\nwould work just as well if your list contained a million or more numbers.\\nList Comprehensions\\nThe approach described earlier for generating the list squares consisted of \\nusing three or four lines of code. A list comprehension allows you to generate \\nthis same list in just one line of code. A list comprehension combines the \\nfor loop and the creation of new elements into one line, and automatically \\nappends each new element. List comprehensions are not always presented \\nto beginners, but I’ve included them here because you’ll most likely see \\nthem as soon as you start looking at other people’s code.\\nThe following example builds the same list of square numbers you saw \\nearlier but uses a list comprehension:\\nsquares.py squares = [value**2 for value in range(1, 11)]\\nprint(squares)'),\n",

Next, open a set of square brackets and define the expression for \\nthe values you want to store in the new list. In this example the expression is \\nvalue**2, which raises the value to the second power. Then, write a for loop \\nto generate the numbers you want to feed into the expression, and close the \\nsquare brackets. The for loop in this example is for value in range(1, 11) , \\nwhich feeds the values 1 through 10 into the expression value**2. Note that \\nno colon is used at the end of the for statement.\\nThe result is the same list of square numbers you saw earlier:\\n[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]\\nIt takes practice to write your own list comprehensions, but you’ll find \\nthem worthwhile once you become comfortable creating ordinary lists. \\nWhen you’re writing three or four lines of code to generate lists and it \\nbegins to feel repetitive, consider writing your own list comprehensions.\\nTRY IT YOURSELF\\n4-3. Counting to Twenty: Use a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 20, \\ninclusive.\\n4-4.

Summing a Million: Make a list of the numbers from one to one million, and \\nthen use min() and max() to make sure your list actually starts at one and ends \\nat one million. Also, use the sum() function to see how quickly Python can add \\na million numbers.\\n4-6. Odd Numbers: Use the third argument of the range() function to make a list \\nof the odd numbers from 1 to 20. Use a for loop to print each number.\\n4-7 . Threes: Make a list of the multiples of 3, from 3 to 30. Use a for loop to \\nprint the numbers in your list.\\n4-8. Cubes: A number raised to the third power is called a cube.

You can also work with a specific group of items in a list, called a slice in \\nPython.\\nSlicing a List\\nTo make a slice, you specify the index of the first and last elements you want \\nto work with. As with the range() function, Python stops one item before the \\nsecond index you specify. To output the first three elements in a list, you \\nwould request indices 0 through 3, which would return elements 0, 1, and 2.\\nThe following example involves a list of players on a team:\\nplayers.py players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']\\nprint(players[0:3])\\nThis code prints a slice of the list. The output retains the structure of \\nthe list, and includes the first three players in the list:\\n['charles', 'martina', 'michael']\\nYou can generate any subset of a list. For example, if you want the sec-\\nond, third, and fourth items in a list, you would start the slice at index 1 and \\nend it at index 4:\\nplayers = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']\\nprint(players[1:4])\\nThis time the slice starts with 'martina' and ends with 'florence':\\n['martina', 'michael', 'florence']\\nIf you omit the first index in a slice, Python automatically starts your \\nslice at the beginning of the list:\\nplayers = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']\\nprint(players[:4])\\nWithout a starting index, Python starts at the beginning of the list:\\n['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence']\\nA similar syntax works if you want a slice that includes the end of a list. \\nFor example, if you want all items from the third item through the last item, \\nyou can start with index 2 and omit the second index:\\nplayers = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']\\nprint(players[2:])\"),\n",

Recall that a nega -\\ntive index returns an element a certain distance from the end of a list; \\ntherefore, you can output any slice from the end of a list. For example, if \\nwe want to output the last three players on the roster, we can use the slice \\nplayers[-3:]:\\nplayers = [\\'charles\\', \\'martina\\', \\'michael\\', \\'florence\\', \\'eli\\']\\nprint(players[-3:])\\nThis prints the names of the last three players and will continue to work \\nas the list of players changes in size.\\nNOTE  You can include a third value in the brackets indicating a slice. If a third value is \\nincluded, this tells Python how many items to skip between items in the specified \\nrange.\\nLooping Through a Slice\\nYou can use a slice in a for loop if you want to loop through a subset of the \\nelements in a list. In the next example, we loop through the first three play -\\ners and print their names as part of a simple roster:\\nplayers = [\\'charles\\', \\'martina\\', \\'michael\\', \\'florence\\', \\'eli\\']\\nprint(\"Here are the first three players on my team:\")\\n1 for player in players[:3]:\\n    print(player.title())\\nInstead of looping through the entire list of players, Python loops \\nthrough only the first three names\\xa0 1:\\nHere are the first three players on my team:\\nCharles\\nMartina\\nMichael\\nSlices are very useful in a number of situations. For instance, when \\nyou’re creating a game, you could add a player’s final score to a list every \\ntime that player finishes playing. You could then get a player’s top three \\nscores by sorting the list in decreasing order and taking a slice that includes \\njust the first three scores. When you’re working with data, you can use slices \\nto process your data in chunks of a specific size. Or, when you’re building \\na web application, you could use slices to display information in a series of \\npages with an appropriate amount of information on each page.'),\n",

This tells Python to \\nmake a slice that starts at the first item and ends with the last item, produc -\\ning a copy of the entire list.\\nFor example, imagine we have a list of our favorite foods and want to \\nmake a separate list of foods that a friend likes.

We can see that \\'ice cream\\' now appears in our \\nfriend’s list but \\'cannoli\\' does not. If we had simply set friend_foods equal to \\nmy_foods, we would not produce two separate lists. For example, here’s what \\nhappens when you try to copy a list without using a slice:\\nmy_foods = [\\'pizza\\', \\'falafel\\', \\'carrot cake\\']\\n# This doesn\\'t work:\\nfriend_foods = my_foods\\nmy_foods.append(\\'cannoli\\')\\nfriend_foods.append(\\'ice cream\\')\\nprint(\"My favorite foods are:\")\\nprint(my_foods)\\nprint(\"\\\\nMy friend\\'s favorite foods are:\")\\nprint(friend_foods)\\nInstead of assigning a copy of my_foods to friend_foods, we set friend_foods \\nequal to my_foods. This syntax actually tells Python to associate the new vari -\\nable friend_foods with the list that is already associated with my_foods, so now \\nboth variables point to the same list.

Take the time to make your code as easy as pos -\\nsible to read. Writing easy-to-read code helps you keep track of what your \\nprograms are doing and helps others understand your code as well.\\nPython programmers have agreed on a number of styling conventions \\nto ensure that everyone’s code is structured in roughly the same way. Once \\nyou’ve learned to write clean Python code, you should be able to understand \\nthe overall structure of anyone else’s Python code, as long as they follow the \\nsame guidelines. If you’re hoping to become a professional programmer at \\nsome point, you should begin following these guidelines as soon as possible \\nto develop good habits.\\nThe Style Guide\\nWhen someone wants to make a change to the Python language, they write \\na Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP). One of the oldest PEPs is PEP 8, which \\ninstructs Python programmers on how to style their code. PEP 8 is fairly \\nlengthy, but much of it relates to more complex coding structures than what \\nyou’ve seen so far.\\nThe Python style guide was written with the understanding that code \\nis read more often than it is written. You’ll write your code once and then \\nstart reading it as you begin debugging. When you add features to a pro -\\ngram, you’ll spend more time reading your code. When you share your \\ncode with other programmers, they’ll read your code as well.\\nGiven the choice between writing code that’s easier to write or code \\nthat’s easier to read, Python programmers will almost always encourage you \\nto write code that’s easier to read. The following guidelines will help you \\nwrite clear code from the start.\\nIndentation\\nPEP 8 recommends that you use four spaces per indentation level. Using \\nfour spaces improves readability while leaving room for multiple levels of \\nindentation on each line.\\nIn a word processing document, people often use tabs rather than \\nspaces to indent. This works well for word processing documents, but the \\nPython interpreter gets confused when tabs are mixed with spaces. Every \\ntext editor provides a setting that lets you use the TAB key but then converts \\neach tab to a set number of spaces. You should definitely use your TAB key, \\nbut also make sure your editor is set to insert spaces rather than tabs into \\nyour document.\\nMixing tabs and spaces in your file can cause problems that are very \\ndifficult to diagnose. If you think you have a mix of tabs and spaces, you \\ncan convert all tabs in a file to spaces in most editors.'),\n",

Historically, this guideline developed because most com -\\nputers could fit only 79 characters on a single line in a terminal window. \\nCurrently, people can fit much longer lines on their screens, but other rea-\\nsons exist to adhere to the 79-character standard line length.\\nProfessional programmers often have several files open on the same \\nscreen, and using the standard line length allows them to see entire lines \\nin two or three files that are open side by side onscreen. PEP 8 also rec -\\nommends that you limit all of your comments to 72 characters per line, \\nbecause some of the tools that generate automatic documentation for \\nlarger projects add formatting characters at the beginning of each com -\\nmented line.\\nThe PEP 8 guidelines for line length are not set in stone, and some \\nteams prefer a 99-character limit. Don’t worry too much about line length \\nin your code as you’re learning, but be aware that people who are working \\ncollaboratively almost always follow the PEP 8 guidelines. Most editors allow \\nyou to set up a visual cue, usually a vertical line on your screen, that shows \\nyou where these limits are.\\nNOTE  Appendix B  shows you how to configure your text editor so it always inserts four \\nspaces each time you press the TAB key and shows a vertical guideline to help you follow \\nthe 79-character limit.\\nBlank Lines\\nTo group parts of your program visually, use blank lines. You should use \\nblank lines to organize your files, but don’t do so excessively. By following \\nthe examples provided in this book, you should strike the right balance. \\nFor example, if you have five lines of code that build a list and then another \\nthree lines that do something with that list, it’s appropriate to place a blank \\nline between the two sections. However, you should not place three or four \\nblank lines between the two sections.\\nBlank lines won’t affect how your code runs, but they will affect the \\nreadability of your code. The Python interpreter uses horizontal inden -\\ntation to interpret the meaning of your code, but it disregards vertical \\nspacing.\\nOther Style Guidelines\\nPEP 8 has many additional styling recommendations, but most of the \\nguidelines refer to more complex programs than what you’re writing at this \\npoint. As you learn more complex Python structures, I’ll share the relevant \\nparts of the PEP 8 guidelines.'),\n",

Imagine you have a list of cars and you want to print out the \\nname of each car. Car names are proper names, so the names of most cars \\nshould be printed in title case. However, the value 'bmw' should be printed \\nin all uppercase. The following code loops through a list of car names and \\nlooks for the value 'bmw'. Whenever the value is 'bmw', it’s printed in upper-\\ncase instead of title case:\\ncars.py cars = ['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota']\\nfor car in cars:\\n1     if car == 'bmw':\\n        print(car.upper())\\n    else:\\n        print(car.title())\\nThe loop in this example first checks if the current value of car is 'bmw'\\xa01. \\nIf it is, the value is printed in uppercase. If the value of car is anything other \\nthan 'bmw', it’s printed in title case:\\nAudi\\nBMW\\nSubaru\\nToyota\\nThis example combines a number of the concepts you’ll learn about \\nin this chapter. Let’s begin by looking at the kinds of tests you can use to \\nexamine the conditions in your program.\\nConditional Tests\\nAt the heart of every if statement is an expression that can be evaluated as \\nTrue or False and is called a conditional test. Python uses the values True and \\nFalse to decide whether the code in an if statement should be executed. If a \\nconditional test evaluates to True, Python executes the code following the if \\nstatement. If the test evaluates to False, Python ignores the code following \\nthe if statement.\\nChecking for Equality\\nMost conditional tests compare the current value of a variable to a specific \\nvalue of interest. The simplest conditional test checks whether the value of a \\nvariable is equal to the value of interest:\\n>>> car = 'bmw'\\n>>> car == 'bmw'\\nTrue\"),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/Emailing Eric Matthes - Python Crash Course-No Starch Press (2023) (3).pdf', 'page': 110}, page_content=\"if Statements \\xa0\\xa0\\xa073\\nThe first line sets the value of car to 'bmw' using a single equal sign, as \\nyou’ve seen many times already. The next line checks whether the value of \\ncar is 'bmw' by using a double equal sign ( ==). This equality operator  returns \\nTrue if the values on the left and right side of the operator match, and False if \\nthey don’t match. The values in this example match, so Python returns True.\\nWhen the value of car is anything other than 'bmw', this test returns False:\\n>>> car = 'audi'\\n>>> car == 'bmw'\\nFalse\\nA single equal sign is really a statement; you might read the first line \\nof code here as “Set the value of car equal to 'audi'.” On the other hand, a \\ndouble equal sign asks a question: “Is the value of car equal to 'bmw'?” Most \\nprogramming languages use equal signs in this way.\\nIgnoring Case When Checking for Equality\\nTesting for equality is case sensitive in Python. For example, two values with \\ndifferent capitalization are not considered equal:\\n>>> car = 'Audi'\\n>>> car == 'audi'\\nFalse\\nIf case matters, this behavior is advantageous. But if case doesn’t matter \\nand instead you just want to test the value of a variable, you can convert the \\nvariable’s value to lowercase before doing the comparison:\\n>>> car = 'Audi'\\n>>> car.lower() == 'audi'\\nTrue\\nThis test will return True no matter how the value 'Audi' is formatted \\nbecause the test is now case insensitive. The lower() method doesn’t change \\nthe value that was originally stored in car, so you can do this kind of com-\\nparison without affecting the original variable:\\n>>> car = 'Audi'\\n>>> car.lower() == 'audi'\\nTrue\\n>>> car\\n'Audi'\\nWe first assign the capitalized string 'Audi' to the variable car. Then, \\nwe convert the value of car to lowercase and compare the lowercase value to \\nthe string 'audi'. The two strings match, so Python returns True. We can see \\nthat the value stored in car has not been affected by the lower() method.\\nWebsites enforce certain rules for the data that users enter in a manner \\nsimilar to this. For example, a site might use a conditional test like this to\"),\n",

When someone submits a \\nnew username, that new username is converted to lowercase and compared \\nto the lowercase versions of all existing usernames. During this check, a user-\\nname like \\'John\\' will be rejected if any variation of \\'john\\' is already in use.\\nChecking for Inequality\\nWhen you want to determine whether two values are not equal, you can use \\nthe inequality operator (!=). Let’s use another if statement to examine how to \\nuse the inequality operator. We’ll store a requested pizza topping in a vari -\\nable and then print a message if the person did not order anchovies:\\ntoppings.py requested_topping = \\'mushrooms\\'\\nif requested_topping != \\'anchovies\\':\\n    print(\"Hold the anchovies!\")\\nThis code compares the value of requested_topping to the value \\'anchovies\\'. \\nIf these two values do not match, Python returns True and executes the code \\nfollowing the if statement. If the two values match, Python returns False and \\ndoes not run the code following the if statement.\\nBecause the value of requested_topping  is not \\'anchovies\\', the print() \\nfunction is executed:\\nHold the anchovies!\\nMost of the conditional expressions you write will test for equality, but \\nsometimes you’ll find it more efficient to test for inequality.\\nNumerical Comparisons\\nTesting numerical values is pretty straightforward. For example, the follow -\\ning code checks whether a person is 18 years old:\\n>>> age = 18\\n>>> age == 18\\nTrue\\nYou can also test to see if two numbers are not equal. For example, the \\nfollowing code prints a message if the given answer is not correct:\\nmagic \\n_number.py\\nanswer = 17\\nif answer != 42:\\n    print(\"That is not the correct answer. Please try again!\")\\nThe conditional test passes, because the value of answer (17) is not equal \\nto 42. Because the test passes, the indented code block is executed:\\nThat is not the correct answer. Please try again!'),\n",

For example, \\nsometimes you might need two conditions to be True to take an action. \\nOther times, you might be satisfied with just one condition being True. The \\nkeywords and and or can help you in these situations.\\nUsing and to Check Multiple Conditions\\nTo check whether two conditions are both True simultaneously, use the key-\\nword and to combine the two conditional tests; if each test passes, the overall \\nexpression evaluates to True. If either test fails or if both tests fail, the expres-\\nsion evaluates to False.\\nFor example, you can check whether two people are both over 21 by \\nusing the following test:\\n>>> age_0 = 22\\n>>> age_1 = 18\\n1 >>> age_0 >= 21 and age_1 >= 21\\nFalse\\n2 >>> age_1 = 22\\n>>> age_0 >= 21 and age_1 >= 21\\nTrue\\nFirst, we define two ages, age_0 and age_1. Then we check whether both \\nages are 21 or older\\xa01. The test on the left passes, but the test on the right \\nfails, so the overall conditional expression evaluates to False. We then change \\nage_1 to 22\\xa02. The value of age_1 is now greater than 21, so both individual \\ntests pass, causing the overall conditional expression to evaluate as True.\\nTo improve readability, you can use parentheses around the individual \\ntests, but they are not required. If you use parentheses, your test would look \\nlike this:\\n(age_0 >= 21) and (age_1 >= 21)'),\n",

An or expression fails only \\nwhen both individual tests fail.\\nLet’s consider two ages again, but this time we’ll look for only one per-\\nson to be over 21:\\n>>> age_0 = 22\\n>>> age_1 = 18\\n1 >>> age_0 >= 21 or age_1 >= 21\\nTrue\\n2 >>> age_0 = 18\\n>>> age_0 >= 21 or age_1 >= 21\\nFalse\\nWe start with two age variables again. Because the test for age_0\\xa01 passes, \\nthe overall expression evaluates to True. We then lower age_0 to 18. In the final \\ntest\\xa02, both tests now fail and the overall expression evaluates to False.\\nChecking Whether a Value Is in a List\\nSometimes it’s important to check whether a list contains a certain value \\nbefore taking an action. For example, you might want to check whether a \\nnew username already exists in a list of current usernames before completing \\nsomeone’s registration on a website. In a mapping project, you might want to \\ncheck whether a submitted location already exists in a list of known locations.\\nTo find out whether a particular value is already in a list, use the key -\\nword in. Let’s consider some code you might write for a pizzeria. We’ll \\nmake a list of toppings a customer has requested for a pizza and then check \\nwhether certain toppings are in the list.\\n>>> requested_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'onions', 'pineapple']\\n>>> 'mushrooms' in requested_toppings\\nTrue\\n>>> 'pepperoni' in requested_toppings\\nFalse\\nThe keyword in tells Python to check for the existence of 'mushrooms' \\nand 'pepperoni' in the list requested_toppings. This technique is quite power-\\nful because you can create a list of essential values, and then easily check \\nwhether the value you’re testing matches one of the values in the list.\\nChecking Whether a Value Is Not in a List\\nOther times, it’s important to know if a value does not appear in a list. You \\ncan use the keyword not in this situation. For example, consider a list of \\nusers who are banned from commenting in a forum. You can check whether \\na user has been banned before allowing that person to submit a comment:\\nbanned_users.py banned_users = ['andrew', 'carolina', 'david']\\nuser = 'marie'\"),\n",

A Boolean expression is just another name for a conditional \\ntest. A Boolean value is either True or False, just like the value of a conditional \\nexpression after it has been evaluated.\\nBoolean values are often used to keep track of certain conditions, such \\nas whether a game is running or whether a user can edit certain content on \\na website:\\ngame_active = True\\ncan_edit = False\\nBoolean values provide an efficient way to track the state of a program \\nor a particular condition that is important in your program.\\nTRY IT YOURSELF\\n5-1. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement \\ndescribing each test and your prediction for the results of each test.

I predict False.\")\\nprint(car == \\'audi\\')\\n• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line \\nevaluates to True or False.\\n• Create at least 10 tests.

You saw several \\nexamples of if statements in the discussion about conditional tests, but now \\nlet’s dig deeper into the topic.\\nSimple if Statements\\nThe simplest kind of if statement has one test and one action:\\nif conditional_test:\\n    do something\\nYou can put any conditional test in the first line and just about any action \\nin the indented block following the test. If the conditional test evaluates to \\nTrue, Python executes the code following the if statement. If the test evaluates \\nto False, Python ignores the code following the if statement.\\nLet’s say we have a variable representing a person’s age, and we want to \\nknow if that person is old enough to vote. The following code tests whether \\nthe person can vote:\\nvoting.py age = 19\\nif age >= 18:\\n    print(\"You are old enough to vote!\")\\nPython checks to see whether the value of age is greater than or equal \\nto 18. It is, so Python executes the indented print() call:\\nYou are old enough to vote!'),\n",

All \\nindented lines after an if statement will be executed if the test passes, and \\nthe entire block of indented lines will be ignored if the test does not pass.\\nYou can have as many lines of code as you want in the block follow -\\ning the if statement. Let’s add another line of output if the person is old \\nenough to vote, asking if the individual has registered to vote yet:\\nage = 19\\nif age >= 18:\\n    print(\"You are old enough to vote!\")\\n    print(\"Have you registered to vote yet?\")\\nThe conditional test passes, and both print() calls are indented, so both \\nlines are printed:\\nYou are old enough to vote!\\nHave you registered to vote yet?\\nIf the value of age is less than 18, this program would produce no output.\\nif-else Statements\\nOften, you’ll want to take one action when a conditional test passes and a dif-\\nferent action in all other cases. Python’s if-else syntax makes this possible. An \\nif-else block is similar to a simple if statement, but the else statement allows \\nyou to define an action or set of actions that are executed when the condi -\\ntional test fails.\\nWe’ll display the same message we had previously if the person is old \\nenough to vote, but this time we’ll add a message for anyone who is not  \\nold enough to vote:\\nage = 17\\n1 if age >= 18:\\n    print(\"You are old enough to vote!\")\\n    print(\"Have you registered to vote yet?\")\\n2 else:\\n    print(\"Sorry, you are too young to vote.\")\\n    print(\"Please register to vote as soon as you turn 18!\")\\nIf the conditional test\\xa0 1 passes, the first block of indented print() \\ncalls is executed. If the test evaluates to False, the else block\\xa02 is executed. \\nBecause age is less than 18 this time, the conditional test fails and the code \\nin the else block is executed:\\nSorry, you are too young to vote.\\nPlease register to vote as soon as you turn 18!\\nThis code works because it has only two possible situations to evaluate: \\na person is either old enough to vote or not old enough to vote.

In a simple if-else chain like this, one of \\nthe two actions will always be executed.\\nThe if-elif-else Chain\\nOften, you’ll need to test more than two possible situations, and to evaluate \\nthese you can use Python’s if-elif-else syntax. Python executes only one \\nblock in an if-elif-else chain. It runs each conditional test in order, until \\none passes. When a test passes, the code following that test is executed and \\nPython skips the rest of the tests.\\nMany real-world situations involve more than two possible conditions. \\nFor example, consider an amusement park that charges different rates for \\ndifferent age groups:\\n•\\t Admission for anyone under age 4 is free.\\n•\\t Admission for anyone between the ages of 4 and 18 is $25.\\n•\\t Admission for anyone age 18 or older is $40.\\nHow can we use an if statement to determine a person’s admission rate? \\nThe following code tests for the age group of a person and then prints an \\nadmission price message:\\namusement \\n_park.py\\nage = 12\\n1 if age < 4:\\n    print(\"Your admission cost is $0.\")\\n2 elif age < 18:\\n    print(\"Your admission cost is $25.\")\\n3 else:\\n    print(\"Your admission cost is $40.\")\\nThe if test\\xa01 checks whether a person is under 4 years old. When the \\ntest passes, an appropriate message is printed and Python skips the rest of \\nthe tests. The elif line\\xa02 is really another if test, which runs only if the \\nprevious test failed. At this point in the chain, we know the person is at least \\n4 years old because the first test failed. If the person is under 18, an appro -\\npriate message is printed and Python skips the else block. If both the if \\nand elif tests fail, Python runs the code in the else block\\xa03.\\nIn this example the if test\\xa01 evaluates to False, so its code block is not \\nexecuted. However, the elif test evaluates to True (12 is less than 18) so its \\ncode is executed. The output is one sentence, informing the user of the \\nadmission cost:\\nYour admission cost is $25.\\nAny age greater than 17 would cause the first two tests to fail. In these \\nsituations, the else block would be executed and the admission price would \\nbe $40.\\nRather than printing the admission price within the if-elif-else block, \\nit would be more concise to set just the price inside the if-elif-else chain'),\n",

After the price is set by the if-elif-else chain, a \\nseparate unindented print() call uses this value to display a message report -\\ning the person’s admission price.\\nThis code produces the same output as the previous example, but the \\npurpose of the if-elif-else chain is narrower. Instead of determining a price \\nand displaying a message, it simply determines the admission price. In addi-\\ntion to being more efficient, this revised code is easier to modify than the \\noriginal approach. To change the text of the output message, you would \\nneed to change only one print() call rather than three separate print() calls.\\nUsing Multiple elif Blocks\\nYou can use as many elif blocks in your code as you like. For example, if the \\namusement park were to implement a discount for seniors, you could add \\none more conditional test to the code to determine whether someone quali-\\nfies for the senior discount. Let’s say that anyone 65 or older pays half the \\nregular admission, or $20:\\nage = 12\\nif age < 4:\\n    price = 0\\nelif age < 18:\\n    price = 25\\nelif age < 65:\\n    price = 40\\nelse:\\n    price = 20\\nprint(f\"Your admission cost is ${price}.\")\\nMost of this code is unchanged. The second elif block now checks to \\nmake sure a person is less than age 65 before assigning them the full admis -\\nsion rate of $40. Notice that the value assigned in the else block needs to \\nbe changed to $20, because the only ages that make it to this block are for \\npeople 65 or older.'),\n",

Other times, it’s clearer to use an addi-\\ntional elif statement that catches the specific condition of interest:\\nage = 12\\nif age < 4:\\n    price = 0\\nelif age < 18:\\n    price = 25\\nelif age < 65:\\n    price = 40\\nelif age >= 65:\\n    price = 20\\nprint(f\"Your admission cost is ${price}.\")\\nThe final elif block assigns a price of $20 when the person is 65 or \\nolder, which is a little clearer than the general else block. With this change, \\nevery block of code must pass a specific test in order to be executed.\\nThe else block is a catchall statement. It matches any condition that \\nwasn’t matched by a specific if or elif test, and that can sometimes include \\ninvalid or even malicious data. If you have a specific final condition you’re \\ntesting for, consider using a final elif block and omit the else block. As a \\nresult, you’ll be more confident that your code will run only under the cor -\\nrect conditions.\\nTesting Multiple Conditions\\nThe if-elif-else chain is powerful, but it’s only appropriate to use when you \\njust need one test to pass. As soon as Python finds one test that passes, it \\nskips the rest of the tests. This behavior is beneficial, because it’s efficient \\nand allows you to test for one specific condition.\\nHowever, sometimes it’s important to check all conditions of interest. In \\nthis case, you should use a series of simple if statements with no elif or else \\nblocks. This technique makes sense when more than one condition could \\nbe True, and you want to act on every condition that is True.\\nLet’s reconsider the pizzeria example. If someone requests a two-topping \\npizza, you’ll need to be sure to include both toppings on their pizza:\\ntoppings.py requested_toppings = [\\'mushrooms\\', \\'extra cheese\\']\\nif \\'mushrooms\\' in requested_toppings:\\n    print(\"Adding mushrooms.\")\\n1 if \\'pepperoni\\' in requested_toppings:\\n    print(\"Adding pepperoni.\")'),\n",

The first if \\nstatement checks to see whether the person requested mushrooms on their \\npizza. If so, a message is printed confirming that topping. The test for pep -\\nperoni\\xa01 is another simple if statement, not an elif or else statement, so \\nthis test is run regardless of whether the previous test passed or not. The \\nlast if statement checks whether extra cheese was requested, regardless of \\nthe results from the first two tests. These three independent tests are exe -\\ncuted every time this program is run.\\nBecause every condition in this example is evaluated, both mushrooms \\nand extra cheese are added to the pizza:\\nAdding mushrooms.\\nAdding extra cheese.\\nFinished making your pizza!\\nThis code would not work properly if we used an if-elif-else block, \\nbecause the code would stop running after only one test passes. Here’s \\nwhat that would look like:\\nrequested_toppings = [\\'mushrooms\\', \\'extra cheese\\']\\nif \\'mushrooms\\' in requested_toppings:\\n    print(\"Adding mushrooms.\")\\nelif \\'pepperoni\\' in requested_toppings:\\n    print(\"Adding pepperoni.\")\\nelif \\'extra cheese\\' in requested_toppings:\\n    print(\"Adding extra cheese.\")\\nprint(\"\\\\nFinished making your pizza!\")\\nThe test for \\'mushrooms\\' is the first test to pass, so mushrooms are added \\nto the pizza. However, the values \\'extra cheese\\' and \\'pepperoni\\' are never \\nchecked, because Python doesn’t run any tests beyond the first test that \\npasses in an if-elif-else chain. The customer’s first topping will be added, \\nbut all of their other toppings will be missed:\\nAdding mushrooms.\\nFinished making your pizza!\\nIn summary, if you want only one block of code to run, use an if-elif-else \\nchain. If more than one block of code needs to run, use a series of indepen-\\ndent if statements.'),\n",

You can efficiently manage changing conditions, \\nsuch as the availability of certain items in a restaurant throughout a shift. \\nYou can also begin to prove that your code works as you expect it to in all \\npossible situations.\\nChecking for Special Items\\nThis chapter began with a simple example that showed how to handle a spe-\\ncial value like \\'bmw\\', which needed to be printed in a different format than \\nother values in the list. Now that you have a basic understanding of condi -\\ntional tests and if statements, let’s take a closer look at how you can watch \\nfor special values in a list and handle those values appropriately.\\nLet’s continue with the pizzeria example. The pizzeria displays a mes -\\nsage whenever a topping is added to your pizza, as it’s being made. The code \\nfor this action can be written very efficiently by making a list of toppings the \\ncustomer has requested and using a loop to announce each topping as it’s \\nadded to the pizza:\\ntoppings.py requested_toppings = [\\'mushrooms\\', \\'green peppers\\', \\'extra cheese\\']\\nfor requested_topping in requested_toppings:\\n    print(f\"Adding {requested_topping}.\")\\nprint(\"\\\\nFinished making your pizza!\")\\nThe output is straightforward because this code is just a simple for loop:\\nAdding mushrooms.\\nAdding green peppers.\\nAdding extra cheese.\\nFinished making your pizza!'),\n",

An if statement \\ninside the for loop can handle this situation appropriately:\\nrequested_toppings = [\\'mushrooms\\', \\'green peppers\\', \\'extra cheese\\']\\nfor requested_topping in requested_toppings:\\n    if requested_topping == \\'green peppers\\':\\n        print(\"Sorry, we are out of green peppers right now.\")\\n    else:\\n        print(f\"Adding {requested_topping}.\")\\nprint(\"\\\\nFinished making your pizza!\")\\nThis time, we check each requested item before adding it to the pizza. \\nThe if statement checks to see if the person requested green peppers. If so, \\nwe display a message informing them why they can’t have green peppers. \\nThe else block ensures that all other toppings will be added to the pizza.\\nThe output shows that each requested topping is handled appropriately.\\nAdding mushrooms.\\nSorry, we are out of green peppers right now.\\nAdding extra cheese.\\nFinished making your pizza!\\nChecking That a List Is Not Empty\\nWe’ve made a simple assumption about every list we’ve worked with so far: \\nwe’ve assumed that each list has at least one item in it. Soon we’ll let users \\nprovide the information that’s stored in a list, so we won’t be able to assume \\nthat a list has any items in it each time a loop is run. In this situation, it’s \\nuseful to check whether a list is empty before running a for loop.\\nAs an example, let’s check whether the list of requested toppings is \\nempty before building the pizza. If the list is empty, we’ll prompt the user \\nand make sure they want a plain pizza. If the list is not empty, we’ll build \\nthe pizza just as we did in the previous examples:\\nrequested_toppings = []\\nif requested_toppings:\\n    for requested_topping in requested_toppings:\\n        print(f\"Adding {requested_topping}.\")\\n    print(\"\\\\nFinished making your pizza!\")\\nelse:\\n    print(\"Are you sure you want a plain pizza?\")\\nThis time we start out with an empty list of requested toppings. Instead \\nof jumping right into a for loop, we do a quick check first. When the name \\nof a list is used in an if statement, Python returns True if the list contains at \\nleast one item; an empty list evaluates to False. If requested_toppings passes \\nthe conditional test, we run the same for loop we used in the previous'),\n",

If the conditional test fails, we print a message asking the cus -\\ntomer if they really want a plain pizza with no toppings.\\nThe list is empty in this case, so the output asks if the user really wants \\na plain pizza:\\nAre you sure you want a plain pizza?\\nIf the list is not empty, the output will show each requested topping \\nbeing added to the pizza.\\nUsing Multiple Lists\\nPeople will ask for just about anything, especially when it comes to pizza \\ntoppings. What if a customer actually wants french fries on their pizza? You \\ncan use lists and if statements to make sure your input makes sense before \\nyou act on it.\\nLet’s watch out for unusual topping requests before we build a pizza. \\nThe following example defines two lists. The first is a list of available top -\\npings at the pizzeria, and the second is the list of toppings that the user has \\nrequested. This time, each item in requested_toppings is checked against the \\nlist of available toppings before it’s added to the pizza:\\navailable_toppings = [\\'mushrooms\\', \\'olives\\', \\'green peppers\\',\\n                      \\'pepperoni\\', \\'pineapple\\', \\'extra cheese\\']\\n1 requested_toppings = [\\'mushrooms\\', \\'french fries\\', \\'extra cheese\\']\\nfor requested_topping in requested_toppings:\\n2     if requested_topping in available_toppings:\\n        print(f\"Adding {requested_topping}.\")\\n3     else:\\n        print(f\"Sorry, we don\\'t have {requested_topping}.\")\\nprint(\"\\\\nFinished making your pizza!\")\\nFirst, we define a list of available toppings at this pizzeria. Note that this \\ncould be a tuple if the pizzeria has a stable selection of toppings. Then, we \\nmake a list of toppings that a customer has requested. There’s an unusual \\nrequest for a topping in this example: \\'french fries\\'\\xa01. Next we loop \\nthrough the list of requested toppings. Inside the loop, we check to see if \\neach requested topping is actually in the list of available toppings\\xa02. If it is,  \\nwe add that topping to the pizza. If the requested topping is not in the list \\nof available toppings, the else block will run\\xa03. The else block prints a mes-\\nsage telling the user which toppings are unavailable.\\nThis code syntax produces clean, informative output:\\nAdding mushrooms.\\nSorry, we don\\'t have french fries.\\nAdding extra cheese.\\nFinished making your pizza!'),\n",

This simple dictionary stores information about a particular alien:\\nalien.py alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\\nprint(alien_0['color'])\\nprint(alien_0['points'])\\nThe dictionary alien_0 stores the alien’s color and point value. The last \\ntwo lines access and display that information, as shown here:\\ngreen\\n5\\nAs with most new programming concepts, using dictionaries takes prac-\\ntice. Once you’ve worked with dictionaries for a bit, you’ll see how effectively \\nthey can model real-world situations.\\nWorking with Dictionaries\\nA dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is connected to \\na value, and you can use a key to access the value associated with that key. A \\nkey’s value can be a number, a string, a list, or even another dictionary. In fact, \\nyou can use any object that you can create in Python as a value in a dictionary.\\nIn Python, a dictionary is wrapped in braces ({}) with a series of key-value \\npairs inside the braces, as shown in the earlier example:\\nalien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\\nA key-value pair  is a set of values associated with each other. When you \\nprovide a key, Python returns the value associated with that key. Every key is \\nconnected to its value by a colon, and individual key-value pairs are separated \\nby commas. You can store as many key-value pairs as you want in a dictionary.\\nThe simplest dictionary has exactly one key-value pair, as shown in this \\nmodified version of the alien_0 dictionary:\\nalien_0 = {'color': 'green'}\\nThis dictionary stores one piece of information about alien_0: the alien’s \\ncolor. The string 'color' is a key in this dictionary, and its associated value \\nis 'green'.\\nAccessing Values in a Dictionary\\nTo get the value associated with a key, give the name of the dictionary and \\nthen place the key inside a set of square brackets, as shown here:\\nalien.py alien_0 = {'color': 'green'}\\nprint(alien_0['color'])\"),\n",

If a \\nplayer shoots down this alien, you can look up how many points they should \\nearn using code like this:\\nalien_0 = {\\'color\\': \\'green\\', \\'points\\': 5}\\nnew_points = alien_0[\\'points\\']\\nprint(f\"You just earned {new_points} points!\")\\nOnce the dictionary has been defined, we pull the value associated with \\nthe key \\'points\\' from the dictionary. This value is then assigned to the vari -\\nable new_points. The last line prints a statement about how many points the \\nplayer just earned:\\nYou just earned 5 points!\\nIf you run this code every time an alien is shot down, the alien’s point \\nvalue will be retrieved.\\nAdding New Key-Value Pairs\\nDictionaries are dynamic structures, and you can add new key-value pairs \\nto a dictionary at any time. To add a new key-value pair, you would give the \\nname of the dictionary followed by the new key in square brackets, along \\nwith the new value.\\nLet’s add two new pieces of information to the alien_0 dictionary: the \\nalien’s x- and y-coordinates, which will help us display the alien at a par -\\nticular position on the screen. Let’s place the alien on the left edge of the \\nscreen, 25 pixels down from the top. Because screen coordinates usually \\nstart at the upper-left corner of the screen, we’ll place the alien on the left \\nedge of the screen by setting the x-coordinate to 0 and 25 pixels from the \\ntop by setting its y-coordinate to positive 25, as shown here:\\nalien.py alien_0 = {\\'color\\': \\'green\\', \\'points\\': 5}\\nprint(alien_0)\\nalien_0[\\'x_position\\'] = 0\\nalien_0[\\'y_position\\'] = 25\\nprint(alien_0)'),\n",

We do the same for the key \\'y_position\\'. When we print the \\nmodified dictionary, we see the two additional key-value pairs:\\n{\\'color\\': \\'green\\', \\'points\\': 5}\\n{\\'color\\': \\'green\\', \\'points\\': 5, \\'x_position\\': 0, \\'y_position\\': 25}\\nThe final version of the dictionary contains four key-value pairs. The \\noriginal two specify color and point value, and two more specify the alien’s \\nposition.\\nDictionaries retain the order in which they were defined. When you \\nprint a dictionary or loop through its elements, you will see the elements in \\nthe same order they were added to the dictionary.\\nStarting with an Empty Dictionary\\nIt’s sometimes convenient, or even necessary, to start with an empty diction -\\nary and then add each new item to it. To start filling an empty dictionary, \\ndefine a dictionary with an empty set of braces and then add each key-value \\npair on its own line. For example, here’s how to build the alien_0 dictionary \\nusing this approach:\\nalien.py alien_0 = {}\\nalien_0[\\'color\\'] = \\'green\\'\\nalien_0[\\'points\\'] = 5\\nprint(alien_0)\\nWe first define an empty alien_0 dictionary, and then add color and \\npoint values to it. The result is the dictionary we’ve been using in previous \\nexamples:\\n{\\'color\\': \\'green\\', \\'points\\': 5}\\nTypically, you’ll use empty dictionaries when storing user-supplied data \\nin a dictionary or when writing code that generates a large number of key-\\nvalue pairs automatically.\\nModifying Values in a Dictionary\\nTo modify a value in a dictionary, give the name of the dictionary with the \\nkey in square brackets and then the new value you want associated with  \\nthat key. For example, consider an alien that changes from green to yellow \\nas a game progresses:\\nalien.py alien_0 = {\\'color\\': \\'green\\'}\\nprint(f\"The alien is {alien_0[\\'color\\']}.\")'),\n",

We’ll store a value representing the alien’s \\ncurrent speed and then use it to determine how far to the right the alien \\nshould move:\\nalien_0 = {\\'x_position\\': 0, \\'y_position\\': 25, \\'speed\\': \\'medium\\'}\\nprint(f\"Original position: {alien_0[\\'x_position\\']}\")\\n# Move the alien to the right.\\n# Determine how far to move the alien based on its current speed.\\n1 if alien_0[\\'speed\\'] == \\'slow\\':\\n    x_increment = 1\\nelif alien_0[\\'speed\\'] == \\'medium\\':\\n    x_increment = 2\\nelse:\\n    # This must be a fast alien.\\n    x_increment = 3\\n# The new position is the old position plus the increment.\\n2 alien_0[\\'x_position\\'] = alien_0[\\'x_position\\'] + x_increment\\nprint(f\"New position: {alien_0[\\'x_position\\']}\")\\nWe start by defining an alien with an initial x position and y position, \\nand a speed of \\'medium\\'. We’ve omitted the color and point values for the \\nsake of simplicity, but this example would work the same way if you included \\nthose key-value pairs as well. We also print the original value of x_position to \\nsee how far the alien moves to the right.\\nAn if-elif-else chain determines how far the alien should move to \\nthe right, and assigns this value to the variable x_increment\\xa01. If the alien’s \\nspeed is \\'slow\\', it moves one unit to the right; if the speed is \\'medium\\', it \\nmoves two units to the right; and if it’s \\'fast\\', it moves three units to the \\nright. Once the increment has been calculated, it’s added to the value of \\nx_position\\xa02, and the result is stored in the dictionary’s x_position.\\nBecause this is a medium-speed alien, its position shifts two units to the \\nright:\\nOriginal x-position: 0\\nNew x-position: 2'),\n",

For example, to \\nturn this medium-speed alien into a fast alien, you would add this line:\\nalien_0['speed'] = 'fast'\\nThe if-elif-else block would then assign a larger value to x_increment \\nthe next time the code runs.\\nRemoving Key-Value Pairs\\nWhen you no longer need a piece of information that’s stored in a diction-\\nary, you can use the del statement to completely remove a key-value pair. \\nAll del needs is the name of the dictionary and the key that you want to \\nremove.\\nFor example, let’s remove the key 'points' from the alien_0 dictionary, \\nalong with its value:\\nalien.py alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\\nprint(alien_0)\\n1 del alien_0['points']\\nprint(alien_0)\\nThe del statement\\xa01 tells Python to delete the key 'points' from the \\ndictionary alien_0 and to remove the value associated with that key as well. \\nThe output shows that the key 'points' and its value of 5 are deleted from \\nthe dictionary, but the rest of the dictionary is unaffected:\\n{'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\\n{'color': 'green'}\\nNOTE  Be aware that the deleted key-value pair is removed permanently.\\nA Dictionary of Similar Objects\\nThe previous example involved storing different kinds of information about \\none object, an alien in a game. You can also use a dictionary to store one \\nkind of information about many objects. For example, say you want to poll a \\nnumber of people and ask them what their favorite programming language \\nis. A dictionary is useful for storing the results of a simple poll, like this:\\nfavorite \\n_languages.py\\nfavorite_languages = {\\n    'jen': 'python',\\n    'sarah': 'c',\\n    'edward': 'rust',\\n    'phil': 'python',\\n    }\"),\n",

Each \\nkey is the name of a person who responded to the poll, and each value is \\ntheir language choice. When you know you’ll need more than one line to \\ndefine a dictionary, press ENTER after the opening brace. Then indent the \\nnext line one level (four spaces) and write the first key-value pair, followed \\nby a comma. From this point forward when you press ENTER, your text edi -\\ntor should automatically indent all subsequent key-value pairs to match the \\nfirst key-value pair.\\nOnce you’ve finished defining the dictionary, add a closing brace on a \\nnew line after the last key-value pair, and indent it one level so it aligns with \\nthe keys in the dictionary. It’s good practice to include a comma after the \\nlast key-value pair as well, so you’re ready to add a new key-value pair on the \\nnext line.\\nNOTE  Most editors have some functionality that helps you format extended lists and dic -\\ntionaries in a similar manner to this example.

Creating a new variable here makes for a \\nmuch cleaner print() call. The output shows Sarah’s favorite language:\\nSarah\\'s favorite language is C.\\nYou could use this same syntax with any individual represented in the \\ndictionary.\\nUsing get() to Access Values\\nUsing keys in square brackets to retrieve the value you’re interested in from a \\ndictionary might cause one potential problem: if the key you ask for doesn’t \\nexist, you’ll get an error.'),\n",

Glossary: A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary. \\nHowever, to avoid confusion, let’s call it a glossary.\\n• Think of five programming words you’ve learned about in the previous \\nchapters. Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store their \\nmeanings as values.\\n• Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. You might \\nprint the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print the word \\non one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. Use the \\nnewline character (\\\\n) to insert a blank line between each word-meaning \\npair in your output.\\nLooping Through a Dictionary\\nA single Python dictionary can contain just a few key-value pairs or millions \\nof pairs. Because a dictionary can contain large amounts of data, Python \\nlets you loop through a dictionary. Dictionaries can be used to store infor -\\nmation in a variety of ways; therefore, several different ways exist to loop \\nthrough them. You can loop through all of a dictionary’s key-value pairs, \\nthrough its keys, or through its values.\\nLooping Through All Key-Value Pairs\\nBefore we explore the different approaches to looping, let’s consider a new \\ndictionary designed to store information about a user on a website. The  \\nfollowing dictionary would store one person’s username, first name, and \\nlast name:\\nuser.py user_0 = {\\n    'username': 'efermi',\\n    'first': 'enrico',\\n    'last': 'fermi',\\n    }\\nYou can access any single piece of information about user_0 based \\non what you’ve already learned in this chapter. But what if you wanted to \\nsee everything stored in this user’s dictionary? To do so, you could loop \\nthrough the dictionary using a for loop:\\nuser_0 = {\\n    'username': 'efermi',\\n    'first': 'enrico',\\n    'last': 'fermi',\\n    }\"),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/Emailing Eric Matthes - Python Crash Course-No Starch Press (2023) (3).pdf', 'page': 137}, page_content='100\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Chapter 6\\nfor key, value in user_0.items():\\n    print(f\"\\\\nKey: {key}\")\\n    print(f\"Value: {value}\")\\nTo write a for loop for a dictionary, you create names for the two vari -\\nables that will hold the key and value in each key-value pair. You can choose \\nany names you want for these two variables. This code would work just as \\nwell if you had used abbreviations for the variable names, like this:\\nfor k, v in user_0.items()\\nThe second half of the for statement includes the name of the dictionary \\nfollowed by the method items(), which returns a sequence of key-value pairs. \\nThe for loop then assigns each of these pairs to the two variables provided. \\nIn the preceding example, we use the variables to print each key, followed \\nby the associated value. The \"\\\\n\" in the first print() call ensures that a blank \\nline is inserted before each key-value pair in the output:\\nKey: username\\nValue: efermi\\nKey: first\\nValue: enrico\\nKey: last\\nValue: fermi\\nLooping through all key-value pairs works particularly well for diction -\\naries like the favorite_languages.py  example on page 96, which stores the \\nsame kind of information for many different keys. If you loop through the \\nfavorite_languages dictionary, you get the name of each person in the dic -\\ntionary and their favorite programming language. Because the keys always \\nrefer to a person’s name and the value is always a language, we’ll use the \\nvariables name and language in the loop instead of key and value. This will \\nmake it easier to follow what’s happening inside the loop:\\nfavorite \\n_languages.py\\nfavorite_languages = {\\n    \\'jen\\': \\'python\\',\\n    \\'sarah\\': \\'c\\',\\n    \\'edward\\': \\'rust\\',\\n    \\'phil\\': \\'python\\',\\n    }\\nfor name, language in favorite_languages.items():\\n    print(f\"{name.title()}\\'s favorite language is {language.title()}.\")\\nThis code tells Python to loop through each key-value pair in the dic -\\ntionary. As it works through each pair the key is assigned to the variable \\nname, and the value is assigned to the variable language. These descriptive \\nnames make it much easier to see what the print() call is doing.'),\n",

All \\nof the dictionaries in the list should have an identical structure, so you can \\nloop through the list and work with each dictionary object in the same way.\\nA List in a Dictionary\\nRather than putting a dictionary inside a list, it’s sometimes useful to put \\na list inside a dictionary. For example, consider how you might describe a \\npizza that someone is ordering. If you were to use only a list, all you could \\nreally store is a list of the pizza’s toppings. With a dictionary, a list of top -\\npings can be just one aspect of the pizza you’re describing.\\nIn the following example, two kinds of information are stored for each \\npizza: a type of crust and a list of toppings. The list of toppings is a value \\nassociated with the key \\'toppings\\'. To use the items in the list, we give the \\nname of the dictionary and the key \\'toppings\\', as we would any value in the \\ndictionary. Instead of returning a single value, we get a list of toppings:\\npizza.py # Store information about a pizza being ordered.\\npizza = {\\n    \\'crust\\': \\'thick\\',\\n    \\'toppings\\': [\\'mushrooms\\', \\'extra cheese\\'],\\n    }\\n# Summarize the order.\\n1 print(f\"You ordered a {pizza[\\'crust\\']}-crust pizza \"\\n    \"with the following toppings:\")\\n2 for topping in pizza[\\'toppings\\']:\\n    print(f\"\\\\t{topping}\")\\nWe begin with a dictionary that holds information about a pizza that \\nhas been ordered. One key in the dictionary is \\'crust\\', and the associated \\nvalue is the string \\'thick\\'. The next key, \\'toppings\\', has a list as its value that \\nstores all requested toppings. We summarize the order before building the \\npizza\\xa01. When you need to break up a long line in a print() call, choose \\nan appropriate point at which to break the line being printed, and end the \\nline with a quotation mark. Indent the next line, add an opening quotation \\nmark, and continue the string. Python will automatically combine all of the \\nstrings it finds inside the parentheses. To print the toppings, we write a for \\nloop\\xa02. To access the list of toppings, we use the key \\'toppings\\', and Python \\ngrabs the list of toppings from the dictionary.\\nThe following output summarizes the pizza that we plan to build:\\nYou ordered a thick-crust pizza with the following toppings:\\n    mushrooms\\n    extra cheese\\nYou can nest a list inside a dictionary anytime you want more than one \\nvalue to be associated with a single key in a dictionary. In the earlier example \\nof favorite programming languages, if we were to store each person’s \\nresponses in a list, people could choose more than one favorite language.'),\n",

Note that some people have one favorite language and others have \\nmultiple favorites. When we loop through the dictionary\\xa0 1, we use the \\nvariable name languages to hold each value from the dictionary, because we \\nknow that each value will be a list. Inside the main dictionary loop, we use \\nanother for loop\\xa02 to run through each person’s list of favorite languages. \\nNow each person can list as many favorite languages as they like:\\nJen\\'s favorite languages are:\\n    Python\\n    Rust\\nSarah\\'s favorite languages are:\\n    C\\nEdward\\'s favorite languages are:\\n    Rust\\n    Go\\nPhil\\'s favorite languages are:\\n    Python\\n    Haskell\\nTo refine this program even further, you could include an if statement \\nat the beginning of the dictionary’s for loop to see whether each person has \\nmore than one favorite language by examining the value of len(languages). \\nIf a person has more than one favorite, the output would stay the same. If \\nthe person has only one favorite language, you could change the wording to \\nreflect that.

For example, if you have several users \\nfor a website, each with a unique username, you can use the usernames as \\nthe keys in a dictionary. You can then store information about each user by \\nusing a dictionary as the value associated with their username. In the fol -\\nlowing listing, we store three pieces of information about each user: their \\nfirst name, last name, and location. We’ll access this information by looping \\nthrough the usernames and the dictionary of information associated with \\neach username:\\nmany_users.py users = {\\n    \\'aeinstein\\': {\\n        \\'first\\': \\'albert\\',\\n        \\'last\\': \\'einstein\\',\\n        \\'location\\': \\'princeton\\',\\n        },\\n    \\'mcurie\\': {\\n        \\'first\\': \\'marie\\',\\n        \\'last\\': \\'curie\\',\\n        \\'location\\': \\'paris\\',\\n        },\\n    }\\n1 for username, user_info in users.items():\\n2     print(f\"\\\\nUsername: {username}\")\\n3     full_name = f\"{user_info[\\'first\\']} {user_info[\\'last\\']}\"\\n    location = user_info[\\'location\\']\\n4     print(f\"\\\\tFull name: {full_name.title()}\")\\n    print(f\"\\\\tLocation: {location.title()}\")\\nWe first define a dictionary called users with two keys: one each for the \\nusernames \\'aeinstein\\' and \\'mcurie\\'. The value associated with each key is \\na dictionary that includes each user’s first name, last name, and location. \\nThen, we loop through the users dictionary\\xa01. Python assigns each key to \\nthe variable username, and the dictionary associated with each username is \\nassigned to the variable user_info. Once inside the main dictionary loop, we \\nprint the username\\xa02.\\nThen, we start accessing the inner dictionary\\xa0 3. The variable user_info, \\nwhich contains the dictionary of user information, has three keys: \\'first\\', \\n\\'last\\', and \\'location\\'. We use each key to generate a neatly formatted full \\nname and location for each person, and then print a summary of what we \\nknow about each user\\xa04:\\nUsername: aeinstein\\n    Full name: Albert Einstein\\n    Location: Princeton'),\n",

To do so, you usually need \\nto get some information from the user. For \\nexample, say someone wants to find out whether \\nthey’re old enough to vote. If you write a program to \\nanswer this question, you need to know the user’s age  \\nbefore you can provide an answer.

When your program needs a name, you’ll be able \\nto prompt the user for a name. When your program needs a list of names, \\nyou’ll be able to prompt the user for a series of names.

You’ll use Python’s while loop to \\nkeep programs running as long as certain conditions remain true.\\nWith the ability to work with user input and the ability to control how \\nlong your programs run, you’ll be able to write fully interactive programs.\\nHow the input() Function Works\\nThe input() function pauses your program and waits for the user to enter \\nsome text. Once Python receives the user’s input, it assigns that input to a \\nvariable to make it convenient for you to work with.\\nFor example, the following program asks the user to enter some text, \\nthen displays that message back to the user:\\nparrot.py message = input(\"Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you: \")\\nprint(message)\\nThe input() function takes one argument: the prompt that we want to \\ndisplay to the user, so they know what kind of information to enter. In this \\nexample, when Python runs the first line, the user sees the prompt Tell me \\nsomething, and I will repeat it back to you: . The program waits while the \\nuser enters their response and continues after the user presses ENTER. The \\nresponse is assigned to the variable message, then print(message) displays the \\ninput back to the user:\\nTell me something, and I will repeat it back to you: Hello everyone!\\nHello everyone!\\nNOTE  Some text editors won’t run programs that prompt the user for input. You can use these \\neditors to write programs that prompt for input, but you’ll need to run these programs \\nfrom a terminal. See “Running Python Programs from a Terminal” on page 11.\\nWriting Clear Prompts\\nEach time you use the input() function, you should include a clear, easy-to-\\nfollow prompt that tells the user exactly what kind of information you’re \\nlooking for. Any statement that tells the user what to enter should work. For \\nexample:\\ngreeter.py name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\\nprint(f\"\\\\nHello, {name}!\")\\nAdd a space at the end of your prompts (after the colon in the preced-\\ning example) to separate the prompt from the user’s response and to make \\nit clear to your user where to enter their text. For example:\\nPlease enter your name: Eric\\nHello, Eric!'),\n",

You can assign your prompt to a variable and pass that variable to the \\ninput() function. This allows you to build your prompt over several lines, \\nthen write a clean input() statement.\\ngreeter.py prompt = \"If you share your name, we can personalize the messages you see.\"\\nprompt += \"\\\\nWhat is your first name? \"\\nname = input(prompt)\\nprint(f\"\\\\nHello, {name}!\")\\nThis example shows one way to build a multiline string. The first line \\nassigns the first part of the message to the variable prompt. In the second \\nline, the operator += takes the string that was assigned to prompt and adds \\nthe new string onto the end.\\nThe prompt now spans two lines, again with space after the question \\nmark for clarity:\\nIf you share your name, we can personalize the messages you see.\\nWhat is your first name? Eric\\nHello, Eric!\\nUsing int() to Accept Numerical Input\\nWhen you use the input() function, Python interprets everything the user \\nenters as a string. Consider the following interpreter session, which asks for \\nthe user’s age:\\n>>> age = input(\"How old are you? \")\\nHow old are you? 21\\n>>> age\\n\\'21\\'\\nThe user enters the number 21, but when we ask Python for the value of \\nage, it returns \\'21\\', the string representation of the numerical value entered. \\nWe know Python interpreted the input as a string because the number is \\nnow enclosed in quotes. If all you want to do is print the input, this works \\nwell. But if you try to use the input as a number, you’ll get an error:\\n>>> age = input(\"How old are you? \")\\nHow old are you? 21\\n1 >>> age >= 18\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\n2 TypeError: \\'>=\\' not supported between instances of \\'str\\' and \\'int\\'\\nWhen you try to use the input to do a numerical comparison\\xa0 1, Python \\nproduces an error because it can’t compare a string to an integer: the string \\n\\'21\\' that’s assigned to age can’t be compared to the numerical value 18\\xa02.'),\n",

This allows the comparison to run \\nsuccessfully:\\n>>> age = input(\"How old are you? \")\\nHow old are you? 21\\n1 >>> age = int(age)\\n>>> age >= 18\\nTrue\\nIn this example, when we enter 21 at the prompt, Python interprets the \\nnumber as a string, but the value is then converted to a numerical represen -\\ntation by int()\\xa01. Now Python can run the conditional test: it compares age \\n(which now represents the numerical value 21) and 18 to see if age is greater \\nthan or equal to 18. This test evaluates to True.\\nHow do you use the int() function in an actual program? Consider a \\nprogram that determines whether people are tall enough to ride a roller \\ncoaster:\\nrollercoaster.py height = input(\"How tall are you, in inches? \")\\nheight = int(height)\\nif height >= 48:\\n    print(\"\\\\nYou\\'re tall enough to ride!\")\\nelse:\\n    print(\"\\\\nYou\\'ll be able to ride when you\\'re a little older.\")\\nThe program can compare height to 48 because height = int(height)  \\nconverts the input value to a numerical representation before the compari -\\nson is made. If the number entered is greater than or equal to 48, we tell \\nthe user that they’re tall enough:\\nHow tall are you, in inches? 71\\nYou\\'re tall enough to ride!\\nWhen you use numerical input to do calculations and comparisons, be \\nsure to convert the input value to a numerical representation first.\\nThe Modulo Operator\\nA useful tool for working with numerical information is the modulo operator (%), \\nwhich divides one number by another number and returns the remainder:\\n>>> 4 % 3\\n1\\n>>> 5 % 3\\n2\\n>>> 6 % 3\\n0\\n>>> 7 % 3\\n1'),\n",

You can use this fact to determine \\nif a number is even or odd:\\neven_or_odd.py number = input(\"Enter a number, and I\\'ll tell you if it\\'s even or odd: \")\\nnumber = int(number)\\nif number % 2 == 0:\\n    print(f\"\\\\nThe number {number} is even.\")\\nelse:\\n    print(f\"\\\\nThe number {number} is odd.\")\\nEven numbers are always divisible by two, so if the modulo of a number \\nand two is zero (here, if number % 2 == 0 ) the number is even.

Multiples of Ten: Ask the user for a number, and then report whether the \\nnumber is a multiple of 10 or not.\\nIntroducing while Loops\\nThe for loop takes a collection of items and executes a block of code once \\nfor each item in the collection. In contrast, the while loop runs as long as, or \\nwhile, a certain condition is true.\\nThe while Loop in Action\\nYou can use a while loop to count up through a series of numbers. For example,  \\nthe following while loop counts from 1 to 5:\\ncounting.py current_number = 1\\nwhile current_number <= 5:'),\n",

The while loop is then set to keep running as long as the value of \\ncurrent_number is less than or equal to 5. The code inside the loop prints the \\nvalue of current_number and then adds 1 to that value with current_number += 1. \\n(The += operator is shorthand for current_number = current_number + 1.)\\nPython repeats the loop as long as the condition current_number <= 5 \\nis true. Because 1 is less than 5, Python prints 1 and then adds 1, making \\nthe current number 2. Because 2 is less than 5, Python prints 2 and adds 1 \\nagain, making the current number 3, and so on. Once the value of current \\n_number is greater than 5, the loop stops running and the program ends:\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\nThe programs you use every day most likely contain while loops. For \\nexample, a game needs a while loop to keep running as long as you want \\nto keep playing, and so it can stop running as soon as you ask it to quit. \\nPrograms wouldn’t be fun to use if they stopped running before we told \\nthem to or kept running even after we wanted to quit, so while loops are \\nquite useful.\\nLetting the User Choose When to Quit\\nWe can make the parrot.py program run as long as the user wants by putting \\nmost of the program inside a while loop. We’ll define a quit value and then \\nkeep the program running as long as the user has not entered the quit value:\\nparrot.py prompt = \"\\\\nTell me something, and I will repeat it back to you:\"\\nprompt += \"\\\\nEnter \\'quit\\' to end the program. \"\\nmessage = \"\"\\nwhile message != \\'quit\\':\\n    message = input(prompt)\\n    print(message)\\nWe first define a prompt that tells the user their two options: entering \\na message or entering the quit value (in this case, \\'quit\\'). Then we set up a \\nvariable message to keep track of whatever value the user enters. We define \\nmessage as an empty string, \"\", so Python has something to check the first \\ntime it reaches the while line. The first time the program runs and Python \\nreaches the while statement, it needs to compare the value of message to \\n\\'quit\\', but no user input has been entered yet. If Python has nothing to \\ncompare, it won’t be able to continue running the program. To solve this'),\n",

But what about more complicated programs in \\nwhich many different events could cause the program to stop running?\\nFor example, in a game, several different events can end the game. \\nWhen the player runs out of ships, their time runs out, or the cities they \\nwere supposed to protect are all destroyed, the game should end. It needs \\nto end if any one of these events happens. If many possible events might \\noccur to stop the program, trying to test all these conditions in one while \\nstatement becomes complicated and difficult.\\nFor a program that should run only as long as many conditions are \\ntrue, you can define one variable that determines whether or not the entire \\nprogram is active. This variable, called a flag, acts as a signal to the pro -\\ngram. We can write our programs so they run while the flag is set to True \\nand stop running when any of several events sets the value of the flag to \\nFalse. As a result, our overall while statement needs to check only one condi-\\ntion: whether the flag is currently True. Then, all our other tests (to see if an \\nevent has occurred that should set the flag to False) can be neatly organized \\nin the rest of the program.\\nLet’s add a flag to parrot.py from the previous section. This flag, which \\nwe’ll call active (though you can call it anything), will monitor whether or \\nnot the program should continue running:\\nprompt = \"\\\\nTell me something, and I will repeat it back to you:\"\\nprompt += \"\\\\nEnter \\'quit\\' to end the program. \"\\nactive = True\\n1 while active:\\n    message = input(prompt)\\n    if message == \\'quit\\':\\n        active = False\\n    else:\\n        print(message)\\nWe set the variable active to True so the program starts in an active \\nstate. Doing so makes the while statement simpler because no comparison is \\nmade in the while statement itself; the logic is taken care of in other parts of \\nthe program. As long as the active variable remains True, the loop will con-\\ntinue running\\xa01.\\nIn the if statement inside the while loop, we check the value of message \\nonce the user enters their input. If the user enters \\'quit\\', we set active to \\nFalse, and the while loop stops. If the user enters anything other than \\'quit\\', \\nwe print their input as a message.\\nThis program has the same output as the previous example where we \\nplaced the conditional test directly in the while statement. But now that we'),\n",

This is useful in complicated programs \\nlike games, in which there may be many events that should each make the \\nprogram stop running. When any of these events causes the active flag to \\nbecome False, the main game loop will exit, a Game Over  message can be \\ndisplayed, and the player can be given the option to play again.\\nUsing break to Exit a Loop\\nTo exit a while loop immediately without running any remaining code in \\nthe loop, regardless of the results of any conditional test, use the break state-\\nment. The break statement directs the flow of your program; you can use it \\nto control which lines of code are executed and which aren’t, so the program \\nonly executes code that you want it to, when you want it to.\\nFor example, consider a program that asks the user about places they’ve \\nvisited. We can stop the while loop in this program by calling break as soon \\nas the user enters the \\'quit\\' value:\\ncities.py prompt = \"\\\\nPlease enter the name of a city you have visited:\"\\nprompt += \"\\\\n(Enter \\'quit\\' when you are finished.) \"\\n1 while True:\\n    city = input(prompt)\\n    if city == \\'quit\\':\\n        break\\n    else:\\n        print(f\"I\\'d love to go to {city.title()}!\")\\nA loop that starts with while True\\xa01 will run forever unless it reaches a \\nbreak statement. The loop in this program continues asking the user to enter \\nthe names of cities they’ve been to until they enter \\'quit\\'. When they enter \\n\\'quit\\', the break statement runs, causing Python to exit the loop:\\nPlease enter the name of a city you have visited:\\n(Enter \\'quit\\' when you are finished.) New York\\nI\\'d love to go to New York!\\nPlease enter the name of a city you have visited:\\n(Enter \\'quit\\' when you are finished.) San Francisco\\nI\\'d love to go to San Francisco!\\nPlease enter the name of a city you have visited:\\n(Enter \\'quit\\' when you are finished.) quit\\nNOTE  You can use the break statement in any of Python’s loops. For example, you could use \\nbreak to quit a for loop that’s working through a list or a dictionary.'),\n",

For example, consider a loop \\nthat counts from 1 to 10 but prints only the odd numbers in that range:\\ncounting.py current_number = 0\\nwhile current_number < 10:\\n1     current_number += 1\\n    if current_number % 2 == 0:\\n        continue\\n    print(current_number)\\nFirst, we set current_number to 0. Because it’s less than 10, Python enters \\nthe while loop. Once inside the loop, we increment the count by 1\\xa0 1, so  \\ncurrent_number is 1. The if statement then checks the modulo of current_number \\nand 2. If the modulo is 0 (which means current_number is divisible by 2), the \\ncontinue statement tells Python to ignore the rest of the loop and return to \\nthe beginning. If the current number is not divisible by 2, the rest of the \\nloop is executed and Python prints the current number:\\n1\\n3\\n5\\n7\\n9\\nAvoiding Infinite Loops\\nEvery while loop needs a way to stop running so it won’t continue to run for-\\never. For example, this counting loop should count from 1 to 5:\\ncounting.py x = 1\\nwhile x <= 5:\\n    print(x)\\n    x += 1\\nHowever, if you accidentally omit the line x += 1, the loop will run \\nforever:\\n# This loop runs forever!\\nx = 1\\nwhile x <= 5:\\n    print(x)'),\n",

We \\nreceived the user’s input and then printed the input or a response to it. \\nThe next time through the while loop, we’d receive another input value and \\nrespond to that. But to keep track of many users and pieces of information, \\nwe’ll need to use lists and dictionaries with our while loops.\\nA for loop is effective for looping through a list, but you shouldn’t mod-\\nify a list inside a for loop because Python will have trouble keeping track of \\nthe items in the list. To modify a list as you work through it, use a while loop. \\nUsing while loops with lists and dictionaries allows you to collect, store, and \\norganize lots of input to examine and report on later.\\nMoving Items from One List to Another\\nConsider a list of newly registered but unverified users of a website. After \\nwe verify these users, how can we move them to a separate list of confirmed \\nusers? One way would be to use a while loop to pull users from the list of \\nunconfirmed users as we verify them and then add them to a separate list of \\nconfirmed users. Here’s what that code might look like:\\nconfirmed \\n_users.py\\n# Start with users that need to be verified,\\n#  and an empty list to hold confirmed users.\\n1 unconfirmed_users = [\\'alice\\', \\'brian\\', \\'candace\\']\\nconfirmed_users = []\\n# Verify each user until there are no more unconfirmed users.\\n#  Move each verified user into the list of confirmed users.\\n2 while unconfirmed_users:\\n3     current_user = unconfirmed_users.pop()\\n    print(f\"Verifying user: {current_user.title()}\")\\n4     confirmed_users.append(current_user)\\n# Display all confirmed users.\\nprint(\"\\\\nThe following users have been confirmed:\")\\nfor confirmed_user in confirmed_users:\\n    print(confirmed_user.title())\\nWe begin with a list of unconfirmed users\\xa01 (Alice, Brian, and Candace) \\nand an empty list to hold confirmed users. The while loop runs as long as \\nthe list unconfirmed_users is not empty\\xa02. Within this loop, the pop() method \\nremoves unverified users one at a time from the end of unconfirmed_users\\xa03. \\nBecause Candace is last in the unconfirmed_users  list, her name will be the \\nfirst to be removed, assigned to current_user, and added to the confirmed_users \\nlist\\xa04.

The \\nremove() function worked because the value we were interested in appeared \\nonly once in the list. But what if you want to remove all instances of a value \\nfrom a list?\\nSay you have a list of pets with the value 'cat' repeated several times. To \\nremove all instances of that value, you can run a while loop until 'cat' is no \\nlonger in the list, as shown here:\\npets.py pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'goldfish', 'cat', 'rabbit', 'cat']\\nprint(pets)\\nwhile 'cat' in pets:\\n    pets.remove('cat')\\nprint(pets)\\nWe start with a list containing multiple instances of 'cat'. After printing \\nthe list, Python enters the while loop because it finds the value 'cat' in the list \\nat least once. Once inside the loop, Python removes the first instance of 'cat', \\nreturns to the while line, and then reenters the loop when it finds that 'cat' is \\nstill in the list. It removes each instance of 'cat' until the value is no longer in \\nthe list, at which point Python exits the loop and prints the list again:\\n['dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'goldfish', 'cat', 'rabbit', 'cat']\\n['dog', 'dog', 'goldfish', 'rabbit']\\nFilling a Dictionary with User Input\\nYou can prompt for as much input as you need in each pass through a while \\nloop.

The first line \\nuses the keyword def to inform Python that you’re defining a function. This \\nis the function definition, which tells Python the name of the function and, if \\napplicable, what kind of information the function needs to do its job. The \\nparentheses hold that information. In this case, the name of the function is \\ngreet_user(), and it needs no information to do its job, so its parentheses are \\nempty. (Even so, the parentheses are required.) Finally, the definition ends \\nin a colon.\\nAny indented lines that follow def greet_user(): make up the body of the \\nfunction. The text on the second line is a comment called a docstring, which \\ndescribes what the function does. When Python generates documentation \\nfor the functions in your programs, it looks for a string immediately after \\nthe function\\'s definition. These strings are usually enclosed in triple quotes, \\nwhich lets you write multiple lines.\\nThe line print(\"Hello!\") is the only line of actual code in the body of \\nthis function, so greet_user() has just one job: print(\"Hello!\").\\nWhen you want to use this function, you have to call it. A function call  \\ntells Python to execute the code in the function. To call a function, you write \\nthe name of the function, followed by any necessary information in paren-\\ntheses. Because no information is needed here, calling our function is as \\nsimple as entering greet_user(). As expected, it prints Hello!:\\nHello!\\nPassing Information to a Function\\nIf you modify the function greet_user() slightly, it can greet the user by \\nname. For the function to do this, you enter username in the parentheses of \\nthe function’s definition at def greet_user(). By adding username here, you \\nallow the function to accept any value of username you specify. The function \\nnow expects you to provide a value for username each time you call it. When \\nyou call greet_user(), you can pass it a name, such as \\'jesse\\', inside the \\nparentheses:\\ndef greet_user(username):\\n    \"\"\"Display a simple greeting.\"\"\"\\n    print(f\"Hello, {username.title()}!\")\\ngreet_user(\\'jesse\\')'),\n",

The function accepts the \\nname you passed it and displays the greeting for that name:\\nHello, Jesse!\\nLikewise, entering greet_user('sarah') calls greet_user(), passes it 'sarah', \\nand prints Hello, Sarah! You can call greet_user() as often as you want and \\npass it any name you want to produce a predictable output every time.\\nArguments and Parameters\\nIn the preceding greet_user() function, we defined greet_user() to require a \\nvalue for the variable username. Once we called the function and gave it the \\ninformation (a person’s name), it printed the right greeting.\\nThe variable username in the definition of greet_user() is an example of a \\nparameter, a piece of information the function needs to do its job. The value \\n'jesse' in greet_user('jesse') is an example of an argument. An argument is \\na piece of information that’s passed from a function call to a function. \\nWhen we call the function, we place the value we want the function to work \\nwith in parentheses. In this case the argument 'jesse' was passed to the \\nfunction greet_user(), and the value was assigned to the parameter username.\\nNOTE  People sometimes speak of arguments and parameters interchangeably. Don’t be sur -\\nprised if you see the variables in a function definition referred to as arguments or the \\nvariables in a function call referred to as parameters.\\nTRY IT YOURSELF\\n8-1.

The function should print a message, such as One of my \\nfavorite books is Alice in Wonderland.

You can pass arguments to your functions \\nin a number of ways. You can use positional arguments , which need to be in \\nthe same order the parameters were written; keyword arguments, where each \\nargument consists of a variable name and a value; and lists and dictionaries \\nof values.

The simplest way to  \\ndo this is based on the order of the arguments provided. Values matched \\nup this way are called positional arguments.\\nTo see how this works, consider a function that displays information \\nabout pets. The function tells us what kind of animal each pet is and the \\npet’s name, as shown here:\\npets.py 1 def describe_pet(animal_type, pet_name):\\n    \"\"\"Display information about a pet.\"\"\"\\n    print(f\"\\\\nI have a {animal_type}.\")\\n    print(f\"My {animal_type}\\'s name is {pet_name.title()}.\")\\n2 describe_pet(\\'hamster\\', \\'harry\\')\\nThe definition shows that this function needs a type of animal and the \\nanimal’s name\\xa01. When we call describe_pet(), we need to provide an ani-\\nmal type and a name, in that order. For example, in the function call, the \\nargument \\'hamster\\' is assigned to the parameter animal_type and the argu-\\nment \\'harry\\' is assigned to the parameter pet_name\\xa02. In the function body, \\nthese two parameters are used to display information about the pet being \\ndescribed.\\nThe output describes a hamster named Harry:\\nI have a hamster.\\nMy hamster\\'s name is Harry.\\nMultiple Function Calls\\nYou can call a function as many times as needed. Describing a second, dif -\\nferent pet requires just one more call to describe_pet():\\ndef describe_pet(animal_type, pet_name):\\n    \"\"\"Display information about a pet.\"\"\"\\n    print(f\"\\\\nI have a {animal_type}.\")\\n    print(f\"My {animal_type}\\'s name is {pet_name.title()}.\")\\ndescribe_pet(\\'hamster\\', \\'harry\\')\\ndescribe_pet(\\'dog\\', \\'willie\\')\\nIn this second function call, we pass describe_pet() the arguments \\'dog\\' \\nand \\'willie\\'. As with the previous set of arguments we used, Python matches \\n\\'dog\\' with the parameter animal_type and \\'willie\\' with the parameter pet_name. \\nAs before, the function does its job, but this time it prints values for a dog \\nnamed Willie. Now we have a hamster named Harry and a dog named Willie:\\nI have a hamster.\\nMy hamster\\'s name is Harry.'),\n",

Even if the code for describing a pet were to expand to 10 lines, you \\ncould still describe a new pet in just one line by calling the function again.\\nOrder Matters in Positional Arguments\\nYou can get unexpected results if you mix up the order of the arguments in \\na function call when using positional arguments:\\ndef describe_pet(animal_type, pet_name):\\n    \"\"\"Display information about a pet.\"\"\"\\n    print(f\"\\\\nI have a {animal_type}.\")\\n    print(f\"My {animal_type}\\'s name is {pet_name.title()}.\")\\ndescribe_pet(\\'harry\\', \\'hamster\\')\\nIn this function call, we list the name first and the type of animal \\nsecond. Because the argument \\'harry\\' is listed first this time, that value \\nis assigned to the parameter animal_type. Likewise, \\'hamster\\' is assigned to \\npet_name. Now we have a “harry” named “Hamster”:\\nI have a harry.\\nMy harry\\'s name is Hamster.\\nIf you get funny results like this, check to make sure the order of the \\narguments in your function call matches the order of the parameters in the \\nfunction’s definition.\\nKeyword Arguments\\nA keyword argument  is a name-value pair that you pass to a function. You \\ndirectly associate the name and the value within the argument, so when you \\npass the argument to the function, there’s no confusion (you won’t end up \\nwith a harry named Hamster). Keyword arguments free you from having \\nto worry about correctly ordering your arguments in the function call, and \\nthey clarify the role of each value in the function call.\\nLet’s rewrite pets.py using keyword arguments to call describe_pet():\\ndef describe_pet(animal_type, pet_name):\\n    \"\"\"Display information about a pet.\"\"\"\\n    print(f\"\\\\nI have a {animal_type}.\")\\n    print(f\"My {animal_type}\\'s name is {pet_name.title()}.\")\\ndescribe_pet(animal_type=\\'hamster\\', pet_name=\\'harry\\')'),\n",

But when we call the func-\\ntion, we explicitly tell Python which parameter each argument should be \\nmatched with. When Python reads the function call, it knows to assign the \\nargument \\'hamster\\' to the parameter animal_type and the argument \\'harry\\' to \\npet_name. The output correctly shows that we have a hamster named Harry.\\nThe order of keyword arguments doesn’t matter because Python \\nknows where each value should go. The following two function calls are \\nequivalent:\\ndescribe_pet(animal_type=\\'hamster\\', pet_name=\\'harry\\')\\ndescribe_pet(pet_name=\\'harry\\', animal_type=\\'hamster\\')\\nNOTE  When you use keyword arguments, be sure to use the exact names of the parameters in \\nthe function’s definition.\\nDefault Values\\nWhen writing a function, you can define a default value for each parameter. \\nIf an argument for a parameter is provided in the function call, Python \\nuses the argument value. If not, it uses the parameter’s default value. So \\nwhen you define a default value for a parameter, you can exclude the cor-\\nresponding argument you’d usually write in the function call. Using default \\nvalues can simplify your function calls and clarify the ways your functions \\nare typically used.\\nFor example, if you notice that most of the calls to describe_pet() are \\nbeing used to describe dogs, you can set the default value of animal_type to \\n\\'dog\\'. Now anyone calling describe_pet() for a dog can omit that information:\\ndef describe_pet(pet_name, animal_type=\\'dog\\'):\\n    \"\"\"Display information about a pet.\"\"\"\\n    print(f\"\\\\nI have a {animal_type}.\")\\n    print(f\"My {animal_type}\\'s name is {pet_name.title()}.\")\\ndescribe_pet(pet_name=\\'willie\\')\\nWe changed the definition of describe_pet() to include a default value, \\n\\'dog\\', for animal_type. Now when the function is called with no animal_type \\nspecified, Python knows to use the value \\'dog\\' for this parameter:\\nI have a dog.\\nMy dog\\'s name is Willie.\\nNote that the order of the parameters in the function definition had \\nto be changed. Because the default value makes it unnecessary to specify a \\ntype of animal as an argument, the only argument left in the function call \\nis the pet’s name. Python still interprets this as a positional argument, so  \\nif the function is called with just a pet’s name, that argument will match up \\nwith the first parameter listed in the function’s definition. This is the reason \\nthe first parameter needs to be pet_name.'),\n",

Because no argument is provided for \\nanimal_type, Python uses the default value 'dog'.\\nTo describe an animal other than a dog, you could use a function call \\nlike this:\\ndescribe_pet(pet_name='harry', animal_type='hamster')\\nBecause an explicit argument for animal_type is provided, Python will \\nignore the parameter’s default value.\\nNOTE  When you use default values, any parameter with a default value needs to be listed \\nafter all the parameters that don’t have default values. This allows Python to con -\\ntinue interpreting positional arguments correctly.\\nEquivalent Function Calls\\nBecause positional arguments, keyword arguments, and default values can \\nall be used together, you’ll often have several equivalent ways to call a func -\\ntion. Consider the following definition for describe_pet() with one default \\nvalue provided:\\ndef describe_pet(pet_name, animal_type='dog'):\\nWith this definition, an argument always needs to be provided for \\npet_name, and this value can be provided using the positional or keyword for -\\nmat. If the animal being described is not a dog, an argument for animal_type \\nmust be included in the call, and this argument can also be specified using \\nthe positional or keyword format.\\nAll of the following calls would work for this function:\\n# A dog named Willie.\\ndescribe_pet('willie')\\ndescribe_pet(pet_name='willie')\\n# A hamster named Harry.\\ndescribe_pet('harry', 'hamster')\\ndescribe_pet(pet_name='harry', animal_type='hamster')\\ndescribe_pet(animal_type='hamster', pet_name='harry')\\nEach of these function calls would have the same output as the previous \\nexamples.\\nIt doesn’t really matter which calling style you use. As long as your func -\\ntion calls produce the output you want, just use the style you find easiest to \\nunderstand.\"),\n",

Unmatched arguments occur when you \\nprovide fewer or more arguments than a function needs to do its work. \\nFor example, here’s what happens if we try to call describe_pet() with no \\narguments:\\ndef describe_pet(animal_type, pet_name):\\n    \"\"\"Display information about a pet.\"\"\"\\n    print(f\"\\\\nI have a {animal_type}.\")\\n    print(f\"My {animal_type}\\'s name is {pet_name.title()}.\")\\ndescribe_pet()\\nPython recognizes that some information is missing from the function \\ncall, and the traceback tells us that:\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n1   File \"pets.py\", line 6, in <module>\\n2     describe_pet()\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n3 TypeError: describe_pet() missing 2 required positional arguments: \\n    \\'animal_type\\' and \\'pet_name\\'\\nThe traceback first tells us the location of the problem\\xa0 1, allowing us \\nto look back and see that something went wrong in our function call. Next, \\nthe offending function call is written out for us to see\\xa0 2. Last, the trace -\\nback tells us the call is missing two arguments and reports the names of \\nthe missing arguments\\xa0 3. If this function were in a separate file, we could \\nprobably rewrite the call correctly without having to open that file and read \\nthe function code.\\nPython is helpful in that it reads the function’s code for us and tells us \\nthe names of the arguments we need to provide. This is another motiva -\\ntion for giving your variables and functions descriptive names. If you do, \\nPython’s error messages will be more useful to you and anyone else who \\nmight use your code.\\nIf you provide too many arguments, you should get a similar traceback  \\nthat can help you correctly match your function call to the function definition.\\nTRY IT YOURSELF\\n8-3. T-Shirt: Write a function called make_shirt() that accepts a size and the \\ntext of a message that should be printed on the shirt. The function should print a \\nsentence summarizing the size of the shirt and the message printed on it.\\nCall the function once using positional arguments to make a shirt. Call the \\nfunction a second time using keyword arguments.'),\n",

Large Shirts: Modify the make_shirt() function so that shirts are large \\nby default with a message that reads I love Python. Make a large shirt and a \\nmedium shirt with the default message, and a shirt of any size with a different \\nmessage.\\n8-5. Cities: Write a function called describe_city() that accepts the name of \\na city and its country. The function should print a simple sentence, such as \\nReykjavik is in Iceland. Give the parameter for the country a default value. \\nCall your function for three different cities, at least one of which is not in the \\ndefault country.\\nReturn Values\\nA function doesn’t always have to display its output directly. Instead, it can \\nprocess some data and then return a value or set of values. The value the \\nfunction returns is called a return value. The return statement takes a value \\nfrom inside a function and sends it back to the line that called the func -\\ntion. Return values allow you to move much of your program’s grunt \\nwork into functions, which can simplify the body of your program.\\nReturning a Simple Value\\nLet’s look at a function that takes a first and last name, and returns a neatly \\nformatted full name:\\nformatted \\n_name.py\\ndef get_formatted_name(first_name, last_name):\\n    \"\"\"Return a full name, neatly formatted.\"\"\"\\n1     full_name = f\"{first_name} {last_name}\"\\n2     return full_name.title()\\n3 musician = get_formatted_name(\\'jimi\\', \\'hendrix\\')\\nprint(musician)\\nThe definition of get_formatted_name() takes as parameters a first and \\nlast name. The function combines these two names, adds a space between \\nthem, and assigns the result to full_name\\xa01. The value of full_name is con-\\nverted to title case, and then returned to the calling line\\xa0 2.\\nWhen you call a function that returns a value, you need to provide a \\nvariable that the return value can be assigned to. In this case, the returned \\nvalue is assigned to the variable musician\\xa03. The output shows a neatly for-\\nmatted name made up of the parts of a person’s name:\\nJimi Hendrix\\nThis might seem like a lot of work to get a neatly formatted name when \\nwe could have just written:\\nprint(\"Jimi Hendrix\")'),\n",

You store first and last names separately and \\nthen call this function whenever you want to display a full name.\\nMaking an Argument Optional\\nSometimes it makes sense to make an argument optional, so that people \\nusing the function can choose to provide extra information only if they \\nwant to. You can use default values to make an argument optional.\\nFor example, say we want to expand get_formatted_name() to handle \\nmiddle names as well. A first attempt to include middle names might look \\nlike this:\\ndef get_formatted_name(first_name, middle_name, last_name):\\n    \"\"\"Return a full name, neatly formatted.\"\"\"\\n    full_name = f\"{first_name} {middle_name} {last_name}\"\\n    return full_name.title()\\nmusician = get_formatted_name(\\'john\\', \\'lee\\', \\'hooker\\')\\nprint(musician)\\nThis function works when given a first, middle, and last name. The \\nfunction takes in all three parts of a name and then builds a string out of \\nthem. The function adds spaces where appropriate and converts the full \\nname to title case:\\nJohn Lee Hooker\\nBut middle names aren’t always needed, and this function as written \\nwould not work if you tried to call it with only a first name and a last name. \\nTo make the middle name optional, we can give the middle_name argument \\nan empty default value and ignore the argument unless the user provides a \\nvalue. To make get_formatted_name() work without a middle name, we set the \\ndefault value of middle_name to an empty string and move it to the end of the \\nlist of parameters:\\ndef get_formatted_name(first_name, last_name, middle_name=\\'\\'):\\n    \"\"\"Return a full name, neatly formatted.\"\"\"\\n1     if middle_name:\\n        full_name = f\"{first_name} {middle_name} {last_name}\"\\n2     else:\\n        full_name = f\"{first_name} {last_name}\"\\n    return full_name.title()\\nmusician = get_formatted_name(\\'jimi\\', \\'hendrix\\')\\nprint(musician)\\n3 musician = get_formatted_name(\\'john\\', \\'hooker\\', \\'lee\\')\\nprint(musician)'),\n",

Because \\nthere’s always a first and last name, these parameters are listed first in the \\nfunction’s definition. The middle name is optional, so it’s listed last in the \\ndefinition, and its default value is an empty string.\\nIn the body of the function, we check to see if a middle name has been \\nprovided. Python interprets non-empty strings as True, so the conditional \\ntest if middle_name evaluates to True if a middle name argument is in the \\nfunction call\\xa01. If a middle name is provided, the first, middle, and last \\nnames are combined to form a full name. This name is then changed to \\ntitle case and returned to the function call line, where it’s assigned to the \\nvariable musician and printed. If no middle name is provided, the empty \\nstring fails the if test and the else block runs\\xa02. The full name is made \\nwith just a first and last name, and the formatted name is returned to the \\ncalling line where it’s assigned to musician and printed.\\nCalling this function with a first and last name is straightforward. If \\nwe’re using a middle name, however, we have to make sure the middle \\nname is the last argument passed so Python will match up the positional \\narguments correctly\\xa0 3.\\nThis modified version of our function works for people with just a first \\nand last name, and it works for people who have a middle name as well:\\nJimi Hendrix\\nJohn Lee Hooker\\nOptional values allow functions to handle a wide range of use cases \\nwhile letting function calls remain as simple as possible.\\nReturning a Dictionary\\nA function can return any kind of value you need it to, including more com -\\nplicated data structures like lists and dictionaries. For example, the follow -\\ning function takes in parts of a name and returns a dictionary representing \\na person:\\nperson.py def build_person(first_name, last_name):\\n    \"\"\"Return a dictionary of information about a person.\"\"\"\\n1     person = {\\'first\\': first_name, \\'last\\': last_name}\\n2     return person\\nmusician = build_person(\\'jimi\\', \\'hendrix\\')\\n3 print(musician)\\nThe function build_person() takes in a first and last name, and puts \\nthese values into a dictionary\\xa0 1. The value of first_name is stored with the \\nkey \\'first\\', and the value of last_name is stored with the key \\'last\\'. Then, \\nthe entire dictionary representing the person is returned\\xa0 2. The return \\nvalue is printed\\xa03 with the original two pieces of textual information now \\nstored in a dictionary:\\n{\\'first\\': \\'jimi\\', \\'last\\': \\'hendrix\\'}'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/Emailing Eric Matthes - Python Crash Course-No Starch Press (2023) (3).pdf', 'page': 177}, page_content='140\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Chapter 8\\nThis function takes in simple textual information and puts it into a \\nmore meaningful data structure that lets you work with the information \\nbeyond just printing it. The strings \\'jimi\\' and \\'hendrix\\' are now labeled as \\na first name and last name. You can easily extend this function to accept \\noptional values like a middle name, an age, an occupation, or any other \\ninformation you want to store about a person. For example, the following \\nchange allows you to store a person’s age as well:\\ndef build_person(first_name, last_name, age=None):\\n    \"\"\"Return a dictionary of information about a person.\"\"\"\\n    person = {\\'first\\': first_name, \\'last\\': last_name}\\n    if age:\\n        person[\\'age\\'] = age\\n    return person\\nmusician = build_person(\\'jimi\\', \\'hendrix\\', age=27)\\nprint(musician)\\nWe add a new optional parameter age to the function definition and \\nassign the parameter the special value None, which is used when a variable \\nhas no specific value assigned to it. You can think of None as a placeholder \\nvalue. In conditional tests, None evaluates to False. If the function call \\nincludes a value for age, that value is stored in the dictionary. This function \\nalways stores a person’s name, but it can also be modified to store any other \\ninformation you want about a person.\\nUsing a Function with a while Loop\\nYou can use functions with all the Python structures you’ve learned about \\nso far. For example, let’s use the get_formatted_name() function with a while \\nloop to greet users more formally. Here’s a first attempt at greeting people \\nusing their first and last names:\\ngreeter.py def get_formatted_name(first_name, last_name):\\n    \"\"\"Return a full name, neatly formatted.\"\"\"\\n    full_name = f\"{first_name} {last_name}\"\\n    return full_name.title()\\n# This is an infinite loop!\\nwhile True:\\n1     print(\"\\\\nPlease tell me your name:\")\\n    f_name = input(\"First name: \")\\n    l_name = input(\"Last name: \")\\n    formatted_name = get_formatted_name(f_name, l_name)\\n    print(f\"\\\\nHello, {formatted_name}!\")\\nFor this example, we use a simple version of get_formatted_name() that \\ndoesn’t involve middle names. The while loop asks the user to enter their \\nname, and we prompt for their first and last name separately\\xa0 1.\\nBut there’s one problem with this while loop: We haven’t defined a quit \\ncondition. Where do you put a quit condition when you ask for a series of'),\n",

We want the user to be able to quit as easily as possible, so each \\nprompt should offer a way to quit. The break statement offers a straightfor-\\nward way to exit the loop at either prompt:\\ndef get_formatted_name(first_name, last_name):\\n    \"\"\"Return a full name, neatly formatted.\"\"\"\\n    full_name = f\"{first_name} {last_name}\"\\n    return full_name.title()\\nwhile True:\\n    print(\"\\\\nPlease tell me your name:\")\\n    print(\"(enter \\'q\\' at any time to quit)\")\\n    f_name = input(\"First name: \")\\n    if f_name == \\'q\\':\\n        break\\n    l_name = input(\"Last name: \")\\n    if l_name == \\'q\\':\\n        break\\n    formatted_name = get_formatted_name(f_name, l_name)\\n    print(f\"\\\\nHello, {formatted_name}!\")\\nWe add a message that informs the user how to quit, and then we break \\nout of the loop if the user enters the quit value at either prompt. Now the pro-\\ngram will continue greeting people until someone enters q for either name:\\nPlease tell me your name:\\n(enter \\'q\\' at any time to quit)\\nFirst name: eric\\nLast name: matthes\\nHello, Eric Matthes!\\nPlease tell me your name:\\n(enter \\'q\\' at any time to quit)\\nFirst name: q\\nTRY IT YOURSELF\\n8-6. City Names: Write a function called city_country() that takes in the name \\nof a city and its country. The function should return a string formatted like this:\\n\"Santiago, Chile\"\\nCall your function with at least three city-country pairs, and print the values \\nthat are returned.\\n(continued)'),\n",

Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary \\ndescribing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an \\nalbum title, and it should return a dictionary containing these two pieces of \\ninformation. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different \\nalbums. Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are storing the \\nalbum information correctly.\\nUse None to add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to \\nstore the number of songs on an album. If the calling line includes a value for \\nthe number of songs, add that value to the album’s dictionary. Make at least \\none new function call that includes the number of songs on an album.\\n8-8. User Albums: Start with your program from Exercise 8-7 . Write a while \\nloop that allows users to enter an album’s artist and title. Once you have that \\ninformation, call make_album() with the user’s input and print the dictionary \\nthat’s created. Be sure to include a quit value in the while loop.\\nPassing a List\\nYou’ll often find it useful to pass a list to a function, whether it’s a list of \\nnames, numbers, or more complex objects, such as dictionaries. When you \\npass a list to a function, the function gets direct access to the contents of \\nthe list. Let’s use functions to make working with lists more efficient.\\nSay we have a list of users and want to print a greeting to each. The \\nfollowing example sends a list of names to a function called greet_users(), \\nwhich greets each person in the list individually:\\ngreet_users.py def greet_users(names):\\n    \"\"\"Print a simple greeting to each user in the list.\"\"\"\\n    for name in names:\\n        msg = f\"Hello, {name.title()}!\"\\n        print(msg)\\nusernames = [\\'hannah\\', \\'ty\\', \\'margot\\']\\ngreet_users(usernames)\\nWe define greet_users() so it expects a list of names, which it assigns \\nto the parameter names. The function loops through the list it receives and \\nprints a greeting to each user. Outside of the function, we define a list of \\nusers and then pass the list usernames to greet_users() in the function call:\\nHello, Hannah!\\nHello, Ty!\\nHello, Margot!\\nThis is the output we wanted. Every user sees a personalized greeting, \\nand you can call the function anytime you want to greet a specific set of \\nusers.'),\n",

As long as designs remain in unprinted_designs, the while \\nloop simulates printing each design by removing a design from the end of \\nthe list, storing it in current_design, and displaying a message that the cur -\\nrent design is being printed. It then adds the design to the list of completed \\nmodels. When the loop is finished running, a list of the designs that have \\nbeen printed is displayed:\\nPrinting model: dodecahedron\\nPrinting model: robot pendant\\nPrinting model: phone case\\nThe following models have been printed:\\ndodecahedron\\nrobot pendant\\nphone case\\nWe can reorganize this code by writing two functions, each of which \\ndoes one specific job.

We \\nthen define the function show_completed_models() with one parameter: the list \\nof completed models\\xa02. Given this list, show_completed_models() displays the \\nname of each model that was printed.\\nThis program has the same output as the version without functions, but \\nthe code is much more organized. The code that does most of the work has \\nbeen moved to two separate functions, which makes the main part of the \\nprogram easier to understand.

Then, because we’ve already defined our two functions, \\nall we have to do is call them and pass them the right arguments. We call \\nprint_models() and pass it the two lists it needs; as expected, print_models() \\nsimulates printing the designs. Then we call show_completed_models() and \\npass it the list of completed models so it can report the models that have \\nbeen printed. The descriptive function names allow others to read this code \\nand understand it, even without comments.\\nThis program is easier to extend and maintain than the version with -\\nout functions. If we need to print more designs later on, we can simply call'),\n",

If we realize the printing code needs to be modified, \\nwe can change the code once, and our changes will take place everywhere \\nthe function is called. This technique is more efficient than having to \\nupdate code separately in several places in the program.\\nThis example also demonstrates the idea that every function should \\nhave one specific job. The first function prints each design, and the second \\ndisplays the completed models. This is more beneficial than using one func -\\ntion to do both jobs. If you’re writing a function and notice the function \\nis doing too many different tasks, try to split the code into two functions. \\nRemember that you can always call a function from another function, \\nwhich can be helpful when splitting a complex task into a series of steps.\\nPreventing a Function from Modifying a List\\nSometimes you’ll want to prevent a function from modifying a list. For \\nexample, say that you start with a list of unprinted designs and write a \\nfunction to move them to a list of completed models, as in the previous \\nexample. You may decide that even though you’ve printed all the designs, \\nyou want to keep the original list of unprinted designs for your records. But \\nbecause you moved all the design names out of unprinted_designs, the list is \\nnow empty, and the empty list is the only version you have; the original is \\ngone. In this case, you can address this issue by passing the function a copy \\nof the list, not the original. Any changes the function makes to the list will \\naffect only the copy, leaving the original list intact.\\nYou can send a copy of a list to a function like this:\\nfunction_name(list_name[:])\\nThe slice notation [:] makes a copy of the list to send to the function. If \\nwe didn’t want to empty the list of unprinted designs in printing_models.py, \\nwe could call print_models() like this:\\nprint_models(unprinted_designs[:], completed_models)\\nThe function print_models() can do its work because it still receives the \\nnames of all unprinted designs. But this time it uses a copy of the original \\nunprinted designs list, not the actual unprinted_designs list. The list completed \\n_models will fill up with the names of printed models like it did before, but \\nthe original list of unprinted designs will be unaffected by the function.\\nEven though you can preserve the contents of a list by passing a copy \\nof it to your functions, you should pass the original list to functions unless \\nyou have a specific reason to pass a copy. It’s more efficient for a function to \\nwork with an existing list, because this avoids using the time and memory \\nneeded to make a separate copy. This is especially true when working with \\nlarge lists.'),\n",

Call the func-\\ntion send_messages() with a copy of the list of messages. After calling the func-\\ntion, print both of your lists to show that the original list has retained its messages.\\nPassing an Arbitrary Number of Arguments\\nSometimes you won’t know ahead of time how many arguments a function \\nneeds to accept. Fortunately, Python allows a function to collect an arbi -\\ntrary number of arguments from the calling statement.\\nFor example, consider a function that builds a pizza. It needs to accept a \\nnumber of toppings, but you can’t know ahead of time how many toppings a \\nperson will want. The function in the following example has one parameter, \\n*toppings, but this parameter collects as many arguments as the calling line \\nprovides:\\npizza.py def make_pizza(*toppings):\\n    \"\"\"Print the list of toppings that have been requested.\"\"\"\\n    print(toppings)\\nmake_pizza(\\'pepperoni\\')\\nmake_pizza(\\'mushrooms\\', \\'green peppers\\', \\'extra cheese\\')\\nThe asterisk in the parameter name *toppings tells Python to make a \\ntuple called toppings, containing all the values this function receives. The \\nprint() call in the function body produces output showing that Python can \\nhandle a function call with one value and a call with three values. It treats \\nthe different calls similarly. Note that Python packs the arguments into a \\ntuple, even if the function receives only one value:\\n(\\'pepperoni\\',)\\n(\\'mushrooms\\', \\'green peppers\\', \\'extra cheese\\')\\nNow we can replace the print() call with a loop that runs through the \\nlist of toppings and describes the pizza being ordered:\\ndef make_pizza(*toppings):\\n    \"\"\"Summarize the pizza we are about to make.\"\"\"'),\n",

Python matches positional and keyword \\narguments first and then collects any remaining arguments in the final \\nparameter.\\nFor example, if the function needs to take in a size for the pizza, that \\nparameter must come before the parameter *toppings:\\ndef make_pizza(size, *toppings):\\n    \"\"\"Summarize the pizza we are about to make.\"\"\"\\n    print(f\"\\\\nMaking a {size}-inch pizza with the following toppings:\")\\n    for topping in toppings:\\n        print(f\"- {topping}\")\\nmake_pizza(16, \\'pepperoni\\')\\nmake_pizza(12, \\'mushrooms\\', \\'green peppers\\', \\'extra cheese\\')\\nIn the function definition, Python assigns the first value it receives to \\nthe parameter size. All other values that come after are stored in the tuple \\ntoppings. The function calls include an argument for the size first, followed \\nby as many toppings as needed.\\nNow each pizza has a size and a number of toppings, and each piece of \\ninformation is printed in the proper place, showing size first and toppings \\nafter:\\nMaking a 16-inch pizza with the following toppings:\\n- pepperoni'),\n",

In this case, you can write functions that accept as many key-value \\npairs as the calling statement provides. One example involves building user \\nprofiles: you know you’ll get information about a user, but you’re not sure \\nwhat kind of information you’ll receive. The function build_profile() in the \\nfollowing example always takes in a first and last name, but it accepts an \\narbitrary number of keyword arguments as well:\\nuser_profile.py def build_profile(first, last, **user_info):\\n    \"\"\"Build a dictionary containing everything we know about a user.\"\"\"\\n1     user_info[\\'first_name\\'] = first\\n    user_info[\\'last_name\\'] = last\\n    return user_info\\nuser_profile = build_profile(\\'albert\\', \\'einstein\\',\\n                             location=\\'princeton\\',\\n                             field=\\'physics\\')\\nprint(user_profile)\\nThe definition of build_profile() expects a first and last name, and then \\nit allows the user to pass in as many name-value pairs as they want. The \\ndouble asterisks before the parameter **user_info cause Python to create \\na dictionary called user_info containing all the extra name-value pairs the \\nfunction receives. Within the function, you can access the key-value pairs in \\nuser_info just as you would for any dictionary.\\nIn the body of build_profile(), we add the first and last names to the \\nuser_info dictionary because we’ll always receive these two pieces of infor -\\nmation from the user\\xa01, and they haven’t been placed into the dictionary \\nyet. Then we return the user_info dictionary to the function call line.\\nWe call build_profile(), passing it the first name \\'albert\\', the last \\nname \\'einstein\\', and the two key-value pairs location=\\'princeton\\' and \\nfield=\\'physics\\'. We assign the returned profile to user_profile and print \\nuser_profile:\\n{\\'location\\': \\'princeton\\', \\'field\\': \\'physics\\',\\n\\'first_name\\': \\'albert\\', \\'last_name\\': \\'einstein\\'}\\nThe returned dictionary contains the user’s first and last names and, in \\nthis case, the location and field of study as well.

You can go a step further by \\nstoring your functions in a separate file called a module and then importing \\nthat module into your main program.

Knowing how to import functions \\nalso allows you to use libraries of functions that other programmers have \\nwritten.\\nThere are several ways to import a module, and I’ll show you each of \\nthese briefly.\\nImporting an Entire Module\\nTo start importing functions, we first need to create a module. A module is \\na file ending in .py that contains the code you want to import into your pro -\\ngram. Let’s make a module that contains the function make_pizza(). To make \\nthis module, we’ll remove everything from the file pizza.py except the func-\\ntion make_pizza():\\npizza.py def make_pizza(size, *toppings):\\n    \"\"\"Summarize the pizza we are about to make.\"\"\"\\n    print(f\"\\\\nMaking a {size}-inch pizza with the following toppings:\")\\n    for topping in toppings:\\n        print(f\"- {topping}\")\\nNow we’ll make a separate file called making_pizzas.py in the same \\ndirectory as pizza.py. This file imports the module we just created and then \\nmakes two calls to make_pizza():\\nmaking \\n_pizzas.py\\nimport pizza\\n1 pizza.make_pizza(16, \\'pepperoni\\')\\npizza.make_pizza(12, \\'mushrooms\\', \\'green peppers\\', \\'extra cheese\\')\\nWhen Python reads this file, the line import pizza tells Python to open \\nthe file pizza.py and copy all the functions from it into this program. You \\ndon’t actually see code being copied between files because Python copies \\nthe code behind the scenes, just before the program runs. All you need  \\nto know is that any function defined in pizza.py will now be available in  \\nmaking_pizzas.py.\\nTo call a function from an imported module, enter the name of the \\nmodule you imported, pizza, followed by the name of the function, make \\n_pizza(), separated by a dot\\xa01. This code produces the same output as the \\noriginal program that didn’t import a module:\\nMaking a 16-inch pizza with the following toppings:\\n- pepperoni\\nMaking a 12-inch pizza with the following toppings:\\n- mushrooms\\n- green peppers\\n- extra cheese\\nThis first approach to importing, in which you simply write import fol-\\nlowed by the name of the module, makes every function from the module'),\n",

If you use this kind of import statement to import \\nan entire module named module_name.py, each function in the module is \\navailable through the following syntax:\\nmodule_name.function_name()\\nImporting Specific Functions\\nYou can also import a specific function from a module. Here’s the general \\nsyntax for this approach:\\nfrom module_name import function_name\\nYou can import as many functions as you want from a module by sepa -\\nrating each function’s name with a comma:\\nfrom module_name import function_0, function_1, function_2\\nThe making_pizzas.py example would look like this if we want to import \\njust the function we’re going to use:\\nfrom pizza import make_pizza\\nmake_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')\\nmake_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')\\nWith this syntax, you don’t need to use the dot notation when you call a \\nfunction. Because we’ve explicitly imported the function make_pizza() in the \\nimport statement, we can call it by name when we use the function.\\nUsing as to Give a Function an Alias\\nIf the name of a function you’re importing might conflict with an exist -\\ning name in your program, or if the function name is long, you can use a \\nshort, unique alias—an alternate name similar to a nickname for the func -\\ntion. You’ll give the function this special nickname when you import the \\nfunction.\\nHere we give the function make_pizza() an alias, mp(), by importing make \\n_pizza as mp. The as keyword renames a function using the alias you provide:\\nfrom pizza import make_pizza as mp\\nmp(16, 'pepperoni')\\nmp(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')\\nThe import statement shown here renames the function make_pizza() to \\nmp() in this program. Anytime we want to call make_pizza() we can simply \\nwrite mp() instead, and Python will run the code in make_pizza() while avoid-\\ning any confusion with another make_pizza() function you might have writ-\\nten in this program file.\"),\n",

Giving a module a short \\nalias, like p for pizza, allows you to call the module’s functions more quickly. \\nCalling p.make_pizza() is more concise than calling pizza.make_pizza():\\nimport pizza as p\\np.make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')\\np.make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')\\nThe module pizza is given the alias p in the import statement, but all of \\nthe module’s functions retain their original names. Calling the functions \\nby writing p.make_pizza() is not only more concise than pizza.make_pizza(), \\nbut it also redirects your attention from the module name and allows you \\nto focus on the descriptive names of its functions. These function names, \\nwhich clearly tell you what each function does, are more important to the \\nreadability of your code than using the full module name.\\nThe general syntax for this approach is:\\nimport module_name as mn\\nImporting All Functions in a Module\\nYou can tell Python to import every function in a module by using the aster -\\nisk (*) operator:\\nfrom pizza import *\\nmake_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')\\nmake_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')\\nThe asterisk in the import statement tells Python to copy every function  \\nfrom the module pizza into this program file. Because every function is \\nimported, you can call each function by name without using the dot notation. \\nHowever, it’s best not to use this approach when you’re working with larger \\nmodules that you didn’t write: if the module has a function name that matches \\nan existing name in your project, you can get unexpected results. Python may \\nsee several functions or variables with the same name, and instead of import-\\ning all the functions separately, it will overwrite the functions.\\nThe best approach is to import the function or functions you want, or \\nimport the entire module and use the dot notation. This leads to clear code \\nthat’s easy to read and understand.

You learned how to use \\nfunctions with lists, dictionaries, if statements, and while loops. You also saw \\nhow to store your functions in separate files called modules, so your program \\nfiles will be simpler and easier to understand. Finally, you learned to style \\nyour functions so your programs will continue to be well-structured and as \\neasy as possible for you and others to read.\\nOne of your goals as a programmer should be to write simple code that \\ndoes what you want it to, and functions help you do this.

When \\nyou know a function does its job correctly, you can trust that it will continue \\nto work and move on to your next coding task.\\nFunctions allow you to write code once and then reuse that code as \\nmany times as you want. When you need to run the code in a function, all \\nyou need to do is write a one-line call and the function does its job. When \\nyou need to modify a function’s behavior, you only have to modify one \\nblock of code, and your change takes effect everywhere you’ve made a call \\nto that function.\\nUsing functions makes your programs easier to read, and good func -\\ntion names summarize what each part of a program does.

After our class is written, we’ll use it to \\nmake individual instances, each of which represents one specific dog.\\nCreating the Dog Class\\nEach instance created from the Dog class will store a name and an age, and \\nwe’ll give each dog the ability to sit() and roll_over():\\ndog.py 1 class Dog:\\n    \"\"\"A simple attempt to model a dog.\"\"\"\\n2     def __init__(self, name, age):\\n        \"\"\"Initialize name and age attributes.\"\"\"\\n3         self.name = name\\n        self.age = age\\n4     def sit(self):\\n        \"\"\"Simulate a dog sitting in response to a command.\"\"\"\\n        print(f\"{self.name} is now sitting.\")\\n    def roll_over(self):\\n        \"\"\"Simulate rolling over in response to a command.\"\"\"\\n        print(f\"{self.name} rolled over!\")\\nThere’s a lot to notice here, but don’t worry. You’ll see this structure \\nthroughout this chapter and have lots of time to get used to it. We first \\ndefine a class called Dog\\xa01. By convention, capitalized names refer to classes \\nin Python. There are no parentheses in the class definition because we’re \\ncreating this class from scratch. We then write a docstring describing what \\nthis class does.'),\n",

Everything you learned about \\nfunctions applies to methods as well; the only practical difference for now \\nis the way we’ll call methods. The __init__() method\\xa02 is a special method \\nthat Python runs automatically whenever we create a new instance based \\non the Dog class. This method has two leading underscores and two trail -\\ning underscores, a convention that helps prevent Python’s default method \\nnames from conflicting with your method names. Make sure to use two \\nunderscores on each side of __init__(). If you use just one on each side, the \\nmethod won’t be called automatically when you use your class, which can \\nresult in errors that are difficult to identify.\\nWe define the __init__() method to have three parameters: self, name, \\nand age. The self parameter is required in the method definition, and \\nit must come first, before the other parameters. It must be included in \\nthe definition because when Python calls this method later (to create an \\ninstance of Dog), the method call will automatically pass the self argument. \\nEvery method call associated with an instance automatically passes self, \\nwhich is a reference to the instance itself; it gives the individual instance \\naccess to the attributes and methods in the class. When we make an \\ninstance of Dog, Python will call the __init__() method from the Dog class. \\nWe’ll pass Dog() a name and an age as arguments; self is passed automati -\\ncally, so we don’t need to pass it. Whenever we want to make an instance \\nfrom the Dog class, we’ll provide values for only the last two parameters, name \\nand age.\\nThe two variables defined in the body of the __init__() method each \\nhave the prefix self\\xa03. Any variable prefixed with self is available to every \\nmethod in the class, and we’ll also be able to access these variables through \\nany instance created from the class. The line self.name = name takes the \\nvalue associated with the parameter name and assigns it to the variable name, \\nwhich is then attached to the instance being created. The same process \\nhappens with self.age = age. Variables that are accessible through instances \\nlike this are called attributes.\\nThe Dog class has two other methods defined: sit() and roll_over()\\xa04. \\nBecause these methods don’t need additional information to run, we just \\ndefine them to have one parameter, self. The instances we create later \\nwill have access to these methods. In other words, they’ll be able to sit and \\nroll over. For now, sit() and roll_over() don’t do much. They simply print \\na message saying the dog is sitting or rolling over. But the concept can be \\nextended to realistic situations: if this class were part of a computer game, \\nthese methods would contain code to make an animated dog sit and roll \\nover. If this class was written to control a robot, these methods would direct \\nmovements that cause a robotic dog to sit and roll over.\\nMaking an Instance from a Class\\nThink of a class as a set of instructions for how to make an instance. The \\nDog class is a set of instructions that tells Python how to make individual \\ninstances representing specific dogs.'),\n",

Here, we tell Python to create a dog whose name is \\'Willie\\' \\nand whose age is 6\\xa01. When Python reads this line, it calls the __init__() \\nmethod in Dog with the arguments \\'Willie\\' and 6. The __init__() method \\ncreates an instance representing this particular dog and sets the name and \\nage attributes using the values we provided. Python then returns an instance \\nrepresenting this dog. We assign that instance to the variable my_dog. The \\nnaming convention is helpful here; we can usually assume that a capitalized \\nname like Dog refers to a class, and a lowercase name like my_dog refers to a \\nsingle instance created from a class.\\nAccessing Attributes\\nTo access the attributes of an instance, you use dot notation. We access the \\nvalue of my_dog’s attribute name\\xa02 by writing:\\nmy_dog.name\\nDot notation is used often in Python. This syntax demonstrates how \\nPython finds an attribute’s value. Here, Python looks at the instance my_dog \\nand then finds the attribute name associated with my_dog. This is the same \\nattribute referred to as self.name in the class Dog. We use the same approach \\nto work with the attribute age\\xa03.\\nThe output is a summary of what we know about my_dog:\\nMy dog\\'s name is Willie.\\nMy dog is 6 years old.\\nCalling Methods\\nAfter we create an instance from the class Dog, we can use dot notation to \\ncall any method defined in Dog. Let’s make our dog sit and roll over:\\nclass Dog:\\n    --snip--\\nmy_dog = Dog(\\'Willie\\', 6)\\nmy_dog.sit()\\nmy_dog.roll_over()'),\n",

When Python reads \\nmy_dog.sit(), it looks for the method sit() in the class Dog and runs that \\ncode. Python interprets the line my_dog.roll_over() in the same way.\\nNow Willie does what we tell him to:\\nWillie is now sitting.\\nWillie rolled over!\\nThis syntax is quite useful. When attributes and methods have been \\ngiven appropriately descriptive names like name, age, sit(), and roll_over(), \\nwe can easily infer what a block of code, even one we’ve never seen before, is \\nsupposed to do.\\nCreating Multiple Instances\\nYou can create as many instances from a class as you need.

Restaurant: Make a class called Restaurant. The __init__() method for \\nRestaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type. \\nMake a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of \\ninformation, and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message indi-\\ncating that the restaurant is open.\\nMake an instance called restaurant from your class.

Create three \\ndifferent instances from the class, and call describe_restaurant() for each \\ninstance.\\n9-3. Users: Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name \\nand last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically stored \\nin a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary \\nof the user’s information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints \\na personalized greeting to the user.\\nCreate several instances representing different users, and call both meth -\\nods for each user.\\nWorking with Classes and Instances\\nYou can use classes to represent many real-world situations. Once you write \\na class, you’ll spend most of your time working with instances created from \\nthat class. One of the first tasks you’ll want to do is modify the attributes \\nassociated with a particular instance. You can modify the attributes of an \\ninstance directly or write methods that update attributes in specific ways.\\nThe Car Class\\nLet’s write a new class representing a car. Our class will store information \\nabout the kind of car we’re working with, and it will have a method that \\nsummarizes this information:\\ncar.py class Car:\\n    \"\"\"A simple attempt to represent a car.\"\"\"\\n1     def __init__(self, make, model, year):\\n        \"\"\"Initialize attributes to describe a car.\"\"\"\\n        self.make = make\\n        self.model = model\\n        self.year = year\\n2     def get_descriptive_name(self):\\n        \"\"\"Return a neatly formatted descriptive name.\"\"\"\\n        long_name = f\"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}\"'),\n",

We also give it three other param-\\neters: make, model, and year. The __init__() method takes in these parameters \\nand assigns them to the attributes that will be associated with instances \\nmade from this class. When we make a new Car instance, we’ll need to spec-\\nify a make, model, and year for our instance.\\nWe define a method called get_descriptive_name() \\xa02 that puts a car’s \\nyear, make, and model into one string neatly describing the car. This will spare \\nus from having to print each attribute’s value individually. To work with the \\nattribute values in this method, we use self.make, self.model, and self.year. \\nOutside of the class, we make an instance from the Car class and assign it to \\nthe variable my_new_car\\xa03. Then we call get_descriptive_name() to show what \\nkind of car we have:\\n2024 Audi A4\\nTo make the class more interesting, let’s add an attribute that changes \\nover time. We’ll add an attribute that stores the car’s overall mileage.\\nSetting a Default Value for an Attribute\\nWhen an instance is created, attributes can be defined without being \\npassed in as parameters. These attributes can be defined in the __init__() \\nmethod, where they are assigned a default value.\\nLet’s add an attribute called odometer_reading that always starts with a \\nvalue of 0. We’ll also add a method read_odometer() that helps us read each \\ncar’s odometer:\\nclass Car:\\n    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\\n        \"\"\"Initialize attributes to describe a car.\"\"\"\\n        self.make = make\\n        self.model = model\\n        self.year = year\\n1         self.odometer_reading = 0\\n    def get_descriptive_name(self):\\n        --snip--\\n2     def read_odometer(self):\\n        \"\"\"Print a statement showing the car\\'s mileage.\"\"\"\\n        print(f\"This car has {self.odometer_reading} miles on it.\")\\nmy_new_car = Car(\\'audi\\', \\'a4\\', 2024)\\nprint(my_new_car.get_descriptive_name())\\nmy_new_car.read_odometer()'),\n",

Let’s look at each \\nof these approaches.\\nModifying an Attribute’s Value Directly\\nThe simplest way to modify the value of an attribute is to access the attri -\\nbute directly through an instance. Here we set the odometer reading to 23 \\ndirectly:\\nclass Car:\\n    --snip--\\nmy_new_car = Car('audi', 'a4', 2024)\\nprint(my_new_car.get_descriptive_name())\\nmy_new_car.odometer_reading = 23\\nmy_new_car.read_odometer()\\nWe use dot notation to access the car’s odometer_reading attribute, and \\nset its value directly. This line tells Python to take the instance my_new_car, \\nfind the attribute odometer_reading associated with it, and set the value of \\nthat attribute to 23:\\n2024 Audi A4\\nThis car has 23 miles on it.\\nSometimes you’ll want to access attributes directly like this, but other \\ntimes you’ll want to write a method that updates the value for you.\\nModifying an Attribute’s Value Through a Method\\nIt can be helpful to have methods that update certain attributes for you. \\nInstead of accessing the attribute directly, you pass the new value to a \\nmethod that handles the updating internally.\"),\n",

This \\nmethod takes in a mileage value and assigns it to self.odometer_reading . \\nUsing the my_new_car instance, we call update_odometer() with 23 as an argu -\\nment\\xa01. This sets the odometer reading to 23, and read_odometer() prints \\nthe reading:\\n2024 Audi A4\\nThis car has 23 miles on it.\\nWe can extend the method update_odometer() to do additional work every \\ntime the odometer reading is modified. Let’s add a little logic to make sure \\nno one tries to roll back the odometer reading:\\nclass Car:\\n    --snip--\\n    def update_odometer(self, mileage):\\n        \"\"\"\\n        Set the odometer reading to the given value.\\n        Reject the change if it attempts to roll the odometer back.\\n        \"\"\"\\n1         if mileage >= self.odometer_reading:\\n            self.odometer_reading = mileage\\n        else:\\n2             print(\"You can\\'t roll back an odometer!\")\\nNow update_odometer() checks that the new reading makes sense before \\nmodifying the attribute. If the value provided for mileage is greater than \\nor equal to the existing mileage, self.odometer_reading , you can update \\nthe odometer reading to the new mileage\\xa0 1. If the new mileage is less \\nthan the existing mileage, you’ll get a warning that you can’t roll back an \\nodometer\\xa02.\\nIncrementing an Attribute’s Value Through a Method\\nSometimes you’ll want to increment an attribute’s value by a certain amount, \\nrather than set an entirely new value.

Here’s a \\nmethod that allows us to pass this incremental amount and add that value  \\nto the odometer reading:\\nclass Car:\\n    --snip--\\n    def update_odometer(self, mileage):\\n        --snip--\\n    def increment_odometer(self, miles):\\n        \"\"\"Add the given amount to the odometer reading.\"\"\"\\n        self.odometer_reading += miles\\n1 my_used_car = Car(\\'subaru\\', \\'outback\\', 2019)\\nprint(my_used_car.get_descriptive_name())\\n2 my_used_car.update_odometer(23_500)\\nmy_used_car.read_odometer()\\nmy_used_car.increment_odometer(100)\\nmy_used_car.read_odometer()\\nThe new method increment_odometer() takes in a number of miles, and adds \\nthis value to self.odometer_reading. First, we create a used car, my_used_car\\xa01.  \\nWe set its odometer to 23,500 by calling update_odometer() and passing it \\n23_500\\xa02. Finally, we call increment_odometer()  and pass it 100 to add the  \\n100 miles that we drove between buying the car and registering it:\\n2019 Subaru Outback\\nThis car has 23500 miles on it.\\nThis car has 23600 miles on it.\\nYou can modify this method to reject negative increments so no one \\nuses this function to roll back an odometer as well.\\nNOTE  You can use methods like this to control how users of your program update values \\nsuch as an odometer reading, but anyone with access to the program can set the odom -\\neter reading to any value by accessing the attribute directly.

Print login_attempts again to \\nmake sure it was reset to 0.\\nInheritance\\nYou don’t always have to start from scratch when writing a class. If the class \\nyou’re writing is a specialized version of another class you wrote, you can \\nuse inheritance. When one class inherits from another, it takes on the attri-\\nbutes and methods of the first class. The original class is called the parent \\nclass, and the new class is the child class . The child class can inherit any \\nor all of the attributes and methods of its parent class, but it’s also free to \\ndefine new attributes and methods of its own.\\nThe __init__() Method for a Child Class\\nWhen you’re writing a new class based on an existing class, you’ll often \\nwant to call the __init__() method from the parent class. This will initialize \\nany attributes that were defined in the parent __init__() method and make \\nthem available in the child class.\\nAs an example, let’s model an electric car. An electric car is just a spe -\\ncific kind of car, so we can base our new ElectricCar class on the Car class \\nwe wrote earlier. Then we’ll only have to write code for the attributes and \\nbehaviors specific to electric cars.\\nLet’s start by making a simple version of the ElectricCar class, which \\ndoes everything the Car class does:\\nelectric_car.py 1 class Car:\\n    \"\"\"A simple attempt to represent a car.\"\"\"\\n    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\\n        \"\"\"Initialize attributes to describe a car.\"\"\\n        self.make = make\\n        self.model = model'),\n",

An attribute or \\nmethod that could belong to any car, rather than one that’s specific to an \\nelectric car, should be added to the Car class instead of the ElectricCar class. \\nThen anyone who uses the Car class will have that functionality available as \\nwell, and the ElectricCar class will only contain code for the information \\nand behavior specific to electric vehicles.\\nOverriding Methods from the Parent Class\\nYou can override any method from the parent class that doesn’t fit what \\nyou’re trying to model with the child class. To do this, you define a method in \\nthe child class with the same name as the method you want to override in \\nthe parent class. Python will disregard the parent class method and only pay \\nattention to the method you define in the child class.\\nSay the class Car had a method called fill_gas_tank(). This method is \\nmeaningless for an all-electric vehicle, so you might want to override this \\nmethod. Here’s one way to do that:\\nclass ElectricCar(Car):\\n    --snip--\\n    def fill_gas_tank(self):\\n        \"\"\"Electric cars don\\'t have gas tanks.\"\"\"\\n        print(\"This car doesn\\'t have a gas tank!\")\\nNow if someone tries to call fill_gas_tank() with an electric car, Python \\nwill ignore the method fill_gas_tank() in Car and run this code instead. \\nWhen you use inheritance, you can make your child classes retain what you \\nneed and override anything you don’t need from the parent class.\\nInstances as Attributes\\nWhen modeling something from the real world in code, you may find that \\nyou’re adding more and more detail to a class. You’ll find that you have a \\ngrowing list of attributes and methods and that your files are becoming \\nlengthy. In these situations, you might recognize that part of one class can \\nbe written as a separate class. You can break your large class into smaller \\nclasses that work together; this approach is called composition.\\nFor example, if we continue adding detail to the ElectricCar class, we \\nmight notice that we’re adding many attributes and methods specific to \\nthe car’s battery. When we see this happening, we can stop and move those \\nattributes and methods to a separate class called Battery. Then we can use a \\nBattery instance as an attribute in the ElectricCar class:\\nclass Car:\\n    --snip--\\nclass Battery:\\n    \"\"\"A simple attempt to model a battery for an electric car.\"\"\"\\n1     def __init__(self, battery_size=40):'),\n",

With this approach it’s unclear which classes \\nyou’re using from the module. This approach can also lead to confusion \\nwith names in the file. If you accidentally import a class with the same name \\nas something else in your program file, you can create errors that are hard \\nto diagnose.

You’ll also avoid the potential \\nnaming conflicts that can arise when you import every class in a module.\\nImporting a Module into a Module\\nSometimes you’ll want to spread out your classes over several modules to \\nkeep any one file from growing too large and avoid storing unrelated classes \\nin the same module. When you store your classes in several modules, you \\nmay find that a class in one module depends on a class in another module. \\nWhen this happens, you can import the required class into the first module.\\nFor example, let’s store the Car class in one module and the ElectricCar \\nand Battery classes in a separate module.

To do this, capitalize the \\nfirst letter of each word in the name, and don’t use underscores. Instance \\nand module names should be written in lowercase, with underscores \\nbetween words.\\nEvery class should have a docstring immediately following the class defi -\\nnition. The docstring should be a brief description of what the class does, \\nand you should follow the same formatting conventions you used for writing \\ndocstrings in functions. Each module should also have a docstring describ -\\ning what the classes in a module can be used for.\\nYou can use blank lines to organize code, but don’t use them excessively. \\nWithin a class you can use one blank line between methods, and within a \\nmodule you can use two blank lines to separate classes.\\nIf you need to import a module from the standard library and a module \\nthat you wrote, place the import statement for the standard library module \\nfirst. Then add a blank line and the import statement for the module you \\nwrote. In programs with multiple import statements, this convention makes it \\neasier to see where the different modules used in the program come from.\\nSummary\\nIn this chapter, you learned how to write your own classes. You learned \\nhow to store information in a class using attributes and how to write meth -\\nods that give your classes the behavior they need. You learned to write \\n__init__() methods that create instances from your classes with exactly the \\nattributes you want. You saw how to modify the attributes of an instance \\ndirectly and through methods. You learned that inheritance can simplify \\nthe creation of classes that are related to each other, and you learned to \\nuse instances of one class as attributes in another class to keep each class \\nsimple.\\nYou saw how storing classes in modules and importing classes you need \\ninto the files where they’ll be used can keep your projects organized. You \\nstarted learning about the Python standard library, and you saw an example \\nbased on the random module. Finally, you learned to style your classes using \\nPython conventions.\\nIn Chapter\\xa010, you’ll learn to work with files so you can save the work \\nyou’ve done in a program and the work you’ve allowed users to do.

With \\nthe skills you’ll learn in this chapter, you’ll make your programs more appli-\\ncable, usable, and stable.\\nReading from a File\\nAn incredible amount of data is available in text files. Text files can contain \\nweather data, traffic data, socioeconomic data, literary works, and more. \\nReading from a file is particularly useful in data analysis applications, but \\nit’s also applicable to any situation in which you want to analyze or modify \\ninformation stored in a file. For example, you can write a program that \\nreads in the contents of a text file and rewrites the file with formatting that \\nallows a browser to display it.\\nWhen you want to work with the information in a text file, the first step \\nis to read the file into memory. You can then work through all of the file’s \\ncontents at once or work through the contents line by line.\\nReading the Contents of a File\\nTo begin, we need a file with a few lines of text in it. Let’s start with a file \\nthat contains pi to 30 decimal places, with 10 decimal places per line:\\npi_digits.txt 3.1415926535\\n  8979323846\\n  2643383279\\nTo try the following examples yourself, you can enter these lines in an \\neditor and save the file as pi_digits.txt , or you can download the file from \\nthe book’s resources through https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e. Save the file \\nin the same directory where you’ll store this chapter’s programs.\\nHere’s a program that opens this file, reads it, and prints the contents \\nof the file to the screen:\\nfile_reader.py from pathlib import Path\\n1 path = Path('pi_digits.txt')\\n2 contents = path.read_text()\\nprint(contents)\\nTo work with the contents of a file, we need to tell Python the path to \\nthe file. A path is the exact location of a file or folder on a system. Python \\nprovides a module called pathlib that makes it easier to work with files and \\ndirectories, no matter which operating system you or your program’s users \\nare working with. A module that provides specific functionality like this is \\noften called a library, hence the name pathlib.\\nWe start by importing the Path class from pathlib. There’s a lot you can \\ndo with a Path object that points to a file. For example, you can check that \\nthe file exists before working with it, read the file’s contents, or write new \\ndata to the file. Here, we build a Path object representing the file pi_digits.txt, \\nwhich we assign to the variable path\\xa01. Since this file is saved in the same\"),\n",

If you’re using VS \\nCode, start by opening the folder where you’re storing this chapter’s programs. For \\nexample, if you’re saving your program files in a folder called chapter_10, press \\nCTRL-O ( ⌘-O on macOS), and open that folder.\\nOnce we have a Path object representing pi_digits.txt, we use the read_text() \\nmethod to read the entire contents of the file\\xa02. The contents of the file are \\nreturned as a single string, which we assign to the variable contents. When we \\nprint the value of contents, we see the entire contents of the text file:\\n3.1415926535\\n  8979323846\\n  2643383279\\nThe only difference between this output and the original file is the \\nextra blank line at the end of the output. The blank line appears because \\nread_text() returns an empty string when it reaches the end of the file; this \\nempty string shows up as a blank line.\\nWe can remove the extra blank line by using rstrip() on the contents \\nstring:\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\npath = Path('pi_digits.txt')\\ncontents = path.read_text()\\ncontents = contents.rstrip()\\nprint(contents)\\nRecall from Chapter\\xa02 that Python’s rstrip() method removes, or strips, \\nany whitespace characters from the right side of a string. Now the output \\nmatches the contents of the original file exactly:\\n3.1415926535\\n  8979323846\\n  2643383279\\nWe can strip the trailing newline character when we read the con -\\ntents of the file, by applying the rstrip() method immediately after calling \\nread_text():\\ncontents = path.read_text().rstrip()\\nThis line tells Python to call the read_text() method on the file we’re \\nworking with. Then it applies the rstrip() method to the string that read \\n_text() returns. The cleaned-up string is then assigned to the variable  \\ncontents. This approach is called method chaining, and you’ll see it used often  \\nin programming.\"),\n",

For example, \\nyou might store your program files in a folder called python_work ; inside \\npython_work , you might have another folder called text_files to distinguish \\nyour program files from the text files they’re manipulating. Even though \\ntext_files is in python_work , just passing Path the name of a file in text_files \\nwon’t work, because Python will only look in python_work and stop there; \\nit won’t go on and look in text_files.  To get Python to open files from a \\ndirectory other than the one where your program file is stored, you need \\nto provide the correct path.\\nThere are two main ways to specify paths in programming. A relative \\nfile path tells Python to look for a given location relative to the directory \\nwhere the currently running program file is stored. Since text_files is inside \\npython_work , we need to build a path that starts with the directory text_files , \\nand ends with the filename. Here’s how to build this path:\\npath = Path('text_files/filename.txt')\\nYou can also tell Python exactly where the file is on your computer, \\nregardless of where the program that’s being executed is stored. This is \\ncalled an absolute file path. You can use an absolute path if a relative path \\ndoesn’t work. For instance, if you’ve put text_files in some folder other than \\npython_work , then just passing Path the path 'text_files/ filename.txt' won’t \\nwork because Python will only look for that location inside python_work . \\nYou’ll need to write out an absolute path to clarify where you want Python \\nto look.\\nAbsolute paths are usually longer than relative paths, because they start \\nat your system’s root folder:\\npath = Path('/home/eric/data_files/text_files/filename.txt')\\nUsing absolute paths, you can read files from any location on your sys -\\ntem. For now it’s easiest to store files in the same directory as your program \\nfiles, or in a folder such as text_files within the directory that stores your pro -\\ngram files.\\nNOTE  Windows systems use a backslash (\\\\) instead of a forward slash (/) when displaying \\nfile paths, but you should use forward slashes in your code, even on Windows. The \\npathlib library will automatically use the correct representation of the path when it \\ninteracts with your system, or any user’s system.\\nAccessing a File’s Lines\\nWhen you’re working with a file, you’ll often want to examine each line  \\nof the file.

For example, you \\nmight want to read through a file of weather data and work with any line \\nthat includes the word sunny in the description of that day’s weather. In a \\nnews report, you might look for any line with the tag <headline> and rewrite \\nthat line with a specific kind of formatting.\\nYou can use the splitlines() method to turn a long string into a set of \\nlines, and then use a for loop to examine each line from a file, one at a time:\\n file_reader.py from pathlib import Path\\npath = Path('pi_digits.txt')\\n1 contents = path.read_text()\\n2 lines = contents.splitlines()\\nfor line in lines:\\n    print(line)\\nWe start out by reading the entire contents of the file, as we did ear -\\nlier\\xa01. If you’re planning to work with the individual lines in a file, you \\ndon’t need to strip any whitespace when reading the file.

We then loop over these lines and print each one:\\n3.1415926535\\n  8979323846\\n  2643383279\\nSince we haven’t modified any of the lines, the output matches the \\noriginal text file exactly.\\nWorking with a File’s Contents\\nAfter you’ve read the contents of a file into memory, you can do whatever \\nyou want with that data, so let’s briefly explore the digits of pi. First, we’ll \\nattempt to build a single string containing all the digits in the file with no \\nwhitespace in it:\\npi_string.py from pathlib import Path\\npath = Path('pi_digits.txt')\\ncontents = path.read_text()\\nlines = contents.splitlines()\\npi_string = ''\\n1 for line in lines:\\n    pi_string += line\\nprint(pi_string)\\nprint(len(pi_string))\\nWe start by reading the file and storing each line of digits in a list, just \\nas we did in the previous example.

We write a loop that adds each line of digits to  \\npi_string\\xa01. We print this string, and also show how long the string is:\\n3.1415926535  8979323846  2643383279\\n36\\nThe variable pi_string contains the whitespace that was on the left side \\nof the digits in each line, but we can get rid of that by using lstrip() on \\neach line:\\n--snip--\\nfor line in lines:\\n    pi_string += line.lstrip()\\nprint(pi_string)\\nprint(len(pi_string))\\nNow we have a string containing pi to 30 decimal places. The string \\nis 32 characters long because it also includes the leading 3 and a decimal \\npoint:\\n3.141592653589793238462643383279\\n32\\nNOTE  When Python reads from a text file, it interprets all text in the file as a string.

If we start with a text file that contains pi to 1,000,000 decimal places, \\ninstead of just 30, we can create a single string containing all these digits. \\nWe don’t need to change our program at all, except to pass it a different \\nfile. We’ll also print just the first 50 decimal places, so we don’t have to \\nwatch a million digits scroll by in the terminal:\\npi_string.py from pathlib import Path\\npath = Path(\\'pi_million_digits.txt\\')\\ncontents = path.read_text()\\nlines = contents.splitlines()\\npi_string = \\'\\'\\nfor line in lines:\\n    pi_string += line.lstrip()\\nprint(f\"{pi_string[:52]}...\")\\nprint(len(pi_string))'),\n",

You can skip the temporary \\nvariable and loop directly over the list that splitlines() returns:\\nfor line in contents.splitlines():\\nRemove the temporary variable from each of the programs in this section, \\nto make them more concise.\\nWriting to a File\\nOne of the simplest ways to save data is to write it to a file. When you write \\ntext to a file, the output will still be available after you close the terminal \\ncontaining your program’s output. You can examine output after a program \\nfinishes running, and you can share the output files with others as well. You \\ncan also write programs that read the text back into memory and work with \\nit again later.\\nWriting a Single Line\\nOnce you have a path defined, you can write to a file using the write_text() \\nmethod. To see how this works, let’s write a simple message and store it in a \\nfile instead of printing it to the screen:\\nwrite \\n_message.py\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\npath = Path(\\'programming.txt\\')\\npath.write_text(\"I love programming.\")\\nThe write_text() method takes a single argument: the string that you \\nwant to write to the file. This program has no terminal output, but if you \\nopen the file programming.txt, you’ll see one line:\\nprogramming.txt I love programming.'),\n",

If you want to store numerical data \\nin a text file, you’ll have to convert the data to string format first using the str() \\nfunction.\\nWriting Multiple Lines\\nThe write_text() method does a few things behind the scenes. If the file that \\npath points to doesn’t exist, it creates that file. Also, after writing the string \\nto the file, it makes sure the file is closed properly. Files that aren’t closed \\nproperly can lead to missing or corrupted data.\\nTo write more than one line to a file, you need to build a string contain-\\ning the entire contents of the file, and then call write_text() with that string. \\nLet’s write several lines to the programming.txt file:\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\ncontents = \"I love programming.\\\\n\"\\ncontents += \"I love creating new games.\\\\n\"\\ncontents += \"I also love working with data.\\\\n\"\\npath = Path(\\'programming.txt\\')\\npath.write_text(contents)\\nWe define a variable called contents that will hold the entire contents of \\nthe file.

Whenever an error occurs that makes Python \\nunsure of what to do next, it creates an exception object. If you write code \\nthat handles the exception, the program will continue running. If you don’t \\nhandle the exception, the program will halt and show a traceback , which \\nincludes a report of the exception that was raised.\\nExceptions are handled with try-except blocks. A try-except block asks \\nPython to do something, but it also tells Python what to do if an excep -\\ntion is raised. When you use try-except blocks, your programs will continue \\nrunning even if things start to go wrong. Instead of tracebacks, which can \\nbe confusing for users to read, users will see friendly error messages that \\nyou’ve written.\\nHandling the ZeroDivisionError Exception\\nLet’s look at a simple error that causes Python to raise an exception. You \\nprobably know that it’s impossible to divide a number by zero, but let’s ask \\nPython to do it anyway:\\ndivision \\n_calculator.py\\nprint(5/0)\\nPython can’t do this, so we get a traceback:\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"division_calculator.py\", line 1, in <module>\\n    print(5/0)\\n          ~^~\\n1 ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\\nThe error reported in the traceback, ZeroDivisionError, is an exception \\nobject\\xa01. Python creates this kind of object in response to a situation where \\nit can’t do what we ask it to. When this happens, Python stops the program \\nand tells us the kind of exception that was raised. We can use this informa -\\ntion to modify our program. We’ll tell Python what to do when this kind of \\nexception occurs; that way, if it happens again, we’ll be prepared.'),\n",

You tell Python to try running \\nsome code, and you tell it what to do if the code results in a particular kind \\nof exception.\\nHere’s what a try-except block for handling the ZeroDivisionError excep-\\ntion looks like:\\ntry:\\n    print(5/0)\\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\\n    print(\"You can\\'t divide by zero!\")\\nWe put print(5/0), the line that caused the error, inside a try block. If \\nthe code in a try block works, Python skips over the except block. If the code \\nin the try block causes an error, Python looks for an except block whose \\nerror matches the one that was raised, and runs the code in that block.\\nIn this example, the code in the try block produces a ZeroDivisionError, \\nso Python looks for an except block telling it how to respond. Python then \\nruns the code in that block, and the user sees a friendly error message \\ninstead of a traceback:\\nYou can\\'t divide by zero!\\nIf more code followed the try-except block, the program would continue \\nrunning because we told Python how to handle the error.

Your code will be resistant to innocent user mistakes and mali -\\ncious attacks.\\nHandling the FileNotFoundError Exception\\nOne common issue when working with files is handling missing files. The \\nfile you’re looking for might be in a different location, the filename might \\nbe misspelled, or the file might not exist at all. You can handle all of these \\nsituations with a try-except block.\\nLet’s try to read a file that doesn’t exist. The following program tries to \\nread in the contents of Alice in Wonderland, but I haven’t saved the file alice.txt \\nin the same directory as alice.py:\\nalice.py from pathlib import Path\\npath = Path(\\'alice.txt\\')\\ncontents = path.read_text(encoding=\\'utf-8\\')\\nNote that we’re using read_text() in a slightly different way here than \\nwhat you saw earlier. The encoding argument is needed when your system’s \\ndefault encoding doesn’t match the encoding of the file that’s being read. \\nThis is most likely to happen when reading from a file that wasn’t created \\non your system.\\nPython can’t read from a missing file, so it raises an exception:\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n1   File \"alice.py\", line 4, in <module>\\n2     contents = path.read_text(encoding=\\'utf-8\\')\\n               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^'),\n",

It’s often best \\nto start at the very end of the traceback. On the last line, we can see that a \\nFileNotFoundError exception was raised\\xa03. This is important because it tells \\nus what kind of exception to use in the except block that we’ll write.\\nLooking back near the beginning of the traceback\\xa0 1, we can see that \\nthe error occurred at line 4 in the file alice.py. The next line shows the line \\nof code that caused the error\\xa02. The rest of the traceback shows some code \\nfrom the libraries that are involved in opening and reading from files. You \\ndon’t usually need to read through or understand all of these lines in a \\ntraceback.\\nTo handle the error that’s being raised, the try block will begin with \\nthe line that was identified as problematic in the traceback. In our example, \\nthis is the line that contains read_text():\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\npath = Path(\\'alice.txt\\')\\ntry:\\n    contents = path.read_text(encoding=\\'utf-8\\')\\n1 except FileNotFoundError:\\n    print(f\"Sorry, the file {path} does not exist.\")\\nIn this example, the code in the try block produces a FileNotFoundError, \\nso we write an except block that matches that error\\xa01. Python then runs the \\ncode in that block when the file can’t be found, and the result is a friendly \\nerror message instead of a traceback:\\nSorry, the file alice.txt does not exist.\\nThe program has nothing more to do if the file doesn’t exist, so this \\nis all the output we see. Let’s build on this example and see how exception \\nhandling can help when you’re working with more than one file.\\nAnalyzing Text\\nYou can analyze text files containing entire books. Many classic works of \\nliterature are available as simple text files because they are in the pub -\\nlic domain. The texts used in this section come from Project Gutenberg \\n(https://gutenberg.org). Project Gutenberg maintains a collection of literary \\nworks that are available in the public domain, and it’s a great resource \\nif you’re interested in working with literary texts in your programming \\nprojects.'),\n",

We take the string contents, which now contains the entire \\ntext of Alice in Wonderland as one long string, and use split() to produce a \\nlist of all the words in the book\\xa01. Using len() on this list\\xa02 gives us a good \\napproximation of the number of words in the original text. Lastly, we print \\na statement that reports how many words were found in the file.

It’s a good habit to keep comments up to date \\nwhen you’re modifying a program, so the comment has also been changed \\nto a docstring and reworded slightly\\xa01.\\nNow we can write a short loop to count the words in any text we want to \\nanalyze. We do this by storing the names of the files we want to analyze in a \\nlist, and then we call count_words() for each file in the list. We’ll try to count \\nthe words for Alice in Wonderland, Siddhartha, Moby Dick, and Little Women,  \\nwhich are all available in the public domain. I’ve intentionally left siddhartha.txt  \\nout of the directory containing word_count.py , so we can see how well our \\nprogram handles a missing file:\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\ndef count_words(filename):\\n    --snip--\\nfilenames = ['alice.txt', 'siddhartha.txt', 'moby_dick.txt', \\n        'little_women.txt']\\nfor filename in filenames:\\n1     path = Path(filename)\\n    count_words(path)\\nThe names of the files are stored as simple strings. Each string is then \\nconverted to a Path object\\xa01, before the call to count_words(). The missing \\nsiddhartha.txt file has no effect on the rest of the program’s execution:\\nThe file alice.txt has about 29594 words.\\nSorry, the file siddhartha.txt does not exist.\\nThe file moby_dick.txt has about 215864 words.\\nThe file little_women.txt has about 189142 words.\\nUsing the try-except block in this example provides two significant \\nadvantages. We prevent our users from seeing a traceback, and we let the \\nprogram continue analyzing the texts it’s able to find. If we don’t catch \\nthe FileNotFoundError that siddhartha.txt raises, the user would see a full \\ntraceback, and the program would stop running after trying to analyze \\nSiddhartha. It would never analyze Moby Dick or Little Women.\\nFailing Silently\\nIn the previous example, we informed our users that one of the files \\nwas unavailable. But you don’t need to report every exception you catch. \\nSometimes, you’ll want the program to fail silently when an exception \\noccurs and continue on as if nothing happened. To make a program fail \\nsilently, you write a try block as usual, but you explicitly tell Python to do\"),\n",

It’s a reminder that \\nyou’re choosing to do nothing at a specific point in your program’s execu -\\ntion and that you might want to do something there later. For example, \\nin this program we might decide to write any missing filenames to a file \\ncalled missing_files.txt . Our users wouldn’t see this file, but we’d be able to \\nread the file and deal with any missing texts.\\nDeciding Which Errors to Report\\nHow do you know when to report an error to your users and when to let \\nyour program fail silently? If users know which texts are supposed to be \\nanalyzed, they might appreciate a message informing them why some texts \\nwere not analyzed. If users expect to see some results but don’t know which \\nbooks are supposed to be analyzed, they might not need to know that some \\ntexts were unavailable. Giving users information they aren’t looking for \\ncan decrease the usability of your program. Python’s error-handling struc -\\ntures give you fine-grained control over how much to share with users when \\nthings go wrong; it’s up to you to decide how much information to share.\\nWell-written, properly tested code is not very prone to internal errors, \\nsuch as syntax or logical errors. But every time your program depends on \\nsomething external such as user input, the existence of a file, or the avail -\\nability of a network connection, there is a possibility of an exception being \\nraised.

Whatever the focus of your program is, you’ll store the information \\nusers provide in data structures such as lists and dictionaries. When users close \\na program, you’ll almost always want to save the information they entered. A \\nsimple way to do this involves storing your data using the json module.\\nThe json module allows you to convert simple Python data structures \\ninto JSON-formatted strings, and then load the data from that file the next \\ntime the program runs. You can also use json to share data between differ -\\nent Python programs. Even better, the JSON data format is not specific to \\nPython, so you can share data you store in the JSON format with people \\nwho work in many other programming languages. It’s a useful and portable \\nformat, and it’s easy to learn.\\nNOTE  The JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)  format was originally developed for \\nJavaScript. However, it has since become a common format used by many languages, \\nincluding Python.\\nUsing json.dumps() and json.loads()\\nLet’s write a short program that stores a set of numbers and another pro -\\ngram that reads these numbers back into memory. The first program will \\nuse json.dumps() to store the set of numbers, and the second program will use \\njson.loads().\\nThe json.dumps() function takes one argument: a piece of data that should \\nbe converted to the JSON format. The function returns a string, which we can \\nthen write to a data file:\\nnumber \\n_writer.py\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\nimport json\\nnumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]\\n1 path = Path('numbers.json')\\n2 contents = json.dumps(numbers)\\npath.write_text(contents)\\nWe first import the json module, and then create a list of numbers to \\nwork with. Then we choose a filename in which to store the list of num -\\nbers\\xa01. It’s customary to use the file extension .json to indicate that the data \\nin the file is stored in the JSON format. Next, we use the json.dumps()\\xa02 \\nfunction to generate a string containing the JSON representation of the \\ndata we’re working with. Once we have this string, we write it to the file \\nusing the same write_text() method we used earlier.\\nThis program has no output, but let’s open the file numbers.json and \\nlook at it. The data is stored in a format that looks just like Python:\\n[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]\"),\n",

Since the data \\nfile is just a text file with specific formatting, we can read it with the read_text() \\nmethod\\xa02. We then pass the contents of the file to json.loads()\\xa03. This func-\\ntion takes in a JSON-formatted string and returns a Python object (in this \\ncase, a list), which we assign to numbers. Finally, we print the recovered list of \\nnumbers and see that it’s the same list created in number_writer.py:\\n[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]\\nThis is a simple way to share data between two programs.\\nSaving and Reading User-Generated Data\\nSaving data with json is useful when you’re working with user-generated \\ndata, because if you don’t store your user’s information somehow, you’ll \\nlose it when the program stops running. Let’s look at an example where we \\nprompt the user for their name the first time they run a program and then \\nremember their name when they run the program again.\\nLet’s start by storing the user’s name:\\nremember \\n_me.py\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\nimport json\\n1 username = input(\"What is your name? \")\\n2 path = Path(\\'username.json\\')\\ncontents = json.dumps(username)\\npath.write_text(contents)\\n3 print(f\"We\\'ll remember you when you come back, {username}!\")\\nWe first prompt for a username to store\\xa0 1.

If the user-\\nname doesn’t exist, we should move the code that prompts for a new username \\nto a function dedicated to that purpose:\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\nimport json\\ndef get_stored_username(path):\\n    \"\"\"Get stored username if available.\"\"\"\\n    --snip--\\ndef get_new_username(path):\\n    \"\"\"Prompt for a new username.\"\"\"\\n    username = input(\"What is your name? \")\\n    contents = json.dumps(username)\\n    path.write_text(contents)\\n    return username\\ndef greet_user():\\n    \"\"\"Greet the user by name.\"\"\"\\n    path = Path(\\'username.json\\')\\n1     username = get_stored_username(path)\\n    if username:\\n        print(f\"Welcome back, {username}!\")'),\n",

You’ll learn to test functions and classes, and you’ll start \\nto understand how many tests to write for a project.\\nInstalling pytest with pip\\nWhile Python includes a lot of functionality in the standard library, Python \\ndevelopers also depend heavily on third-party packages. A third-party package \\nis a library that’s developed outside the core Python language. Some popu -\\nlar third-party libraries are eventually adopted into the standard library, \\nand end up being included in most Python installations from that point \\nforward. This happens most often with libraries that are unlikely to change \\nmuch once they’ve had their initial bugs worked out. These kinds of librar -\\nies can evolve at the same pace as the overall language.\\nMany packages, however, are kept out of the standard library so they can \\nbe developed on a timeline independent of the language itself. These pack-\\nages tend to be updated more frequently than they would be if they were \\ntied to Python’s development schedule. This is true of pytest and most of the \\nlibraries we’ll use in the second half of this book. You shouldn’t blindly trust \\nevery third-party package, but you also shouldn’t be put off by the fact that a \\nlot of important functionality is implemented through such packages.\\nUpdating pip\\nPython includes a tool called pip that’s used to install third-party packages. \\nBecause pip helps install packages from external resources, it’s updated \\noften to address potential security issues. So, we’ll start by updating pip.\\nOpen a new terminal window and issue the following command:\\n$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip\\n1 Requirement already satisfied: pip in /.../python3.11/site-packages (22.0.4)\\n--snip--\\n2 Successfully installed pip-22.1.2\\nThe first part of this command, python -m pip, tells Python to run the \\nmodule pip. The second part, install --upgrade, tells pip to update a package \\nthat’s already been installed. The last part, pip, specifies which third-party \\npackage should be updated. The output shows that my current version of \\npip, version 22.0.4\\xa01, was replaced by the latest version at the time of this \\nwriting, 22.1.2\\xa02.\\nYou can use this command to update any third-party package installed \\non your system:\\n$ python -m pip install --upgrade package_name\\nNOTE  If you’re using Linux, pip may not be included with your installation of Python. If \\nyou get an error when trying to upgrade pip, see the instructions in Appendix A.'),\n",

Here’s a simple function that \\ntakes in a first and last name, and returns a neatly formatted full name:\\nname \\n_function.py\\ndef get_formatted_name(first, last):\\n    \"\"\"Generate a neatly formatted full name.\"\"\"\\n    full_name = f\"{first} {last}\"\\n    return full_name.title()\\nThe function get_formatted_name()  combines the first and last name \\nwith a space in between to complete a full name, and then capitalizes and \\nreturns the full name. To check that get_formatted_name() works, let’s make \\na program that uses this function. The program names.py lets users enter a \\nfirst and last name, and see a neatly formatted full name:\\nnames.py from name_function import get_formatted_name\\nprint(\"Enter \\'q\\' at any time to quit.\")\\nwhile True:\\n    first = input(\"\\\\nPlease give me a first name: \")\\n    if first == \\'q\\':\\n        break\\n    last = input(\"Please give me a last name: \")\\n    if last == \\'q\\':\\n        break\\n    formatted_name = get_formatted_name(first, last)\\n    print(f\"\\\\tNeatly formatted name: {formatted_name}.\")'),\n",

But say we want \\nto modify get_formatted_name()  so it can also handle middle names. As we \\ndo so, we want to make sure we don’t break the way the function handles \\nnames that have only a first and last name. We could test our code by run -\\nning names.py and entering a name like Janis Joplin every time we modify \\nget_formatted_name(), but that would become tedious. Fortunately, pytest \\nprovides an efficient way to automate the testing of a function’s output. If \\nwe automate the testing of get_formatted_name(), we can always be confident \\nthat the function will work when given the kinds of names we’ve written \\ntests for.\\nUnit Tests and Test Cases\\nThere is a wide variety of approaches to testing software. One of the sim -\\nplest kinds of test is a unit test. A unit test verifies that one specific aspect of \\na function’s behavior is correct. A test case is a collection of unit tests that \\ntogether prove that a function behaves as it’s supposed to, within the full \\nrange of situations you expect it to handle.\\nA good test case considers all the possible kinds of input a function \\ncould receive and includes tests to represent each of these situations. A test \\ncase with full coverage includes a full range of unit tests covering all the pos -\\nsible ways you can use a function. Achieving full coverage on a large project \\ncan be daunting. It’s often good enough to write tests for your code’s criti-\\ncal behaviors and then aim for full coverage only if the project starts to see \\nwidespread use.\\nA Passing Test\\nWith pytest, writing your first unit test is pretty straightforward. We’ll \\nwrite a single test function. The test function will call the function we’re \\ntesting, and we’ll make an assertion about the value that’s returned. If our \\nassertion is correct, the test will pass; if the assertion is incorrect, the test  \\nwill fail.\"),\n",

The \\nname of a test file is important; it must start with test_. When we ask pytest \\nto run the tests we’ve written, it will look for any file that begins with test_, \\nand run all of the tests it finds in that file.\\nIn the test file, we first import the function that we want to test: get \\n_formatted_name(). Then we define a test function: in this case, test_first \\n_last_name()\\xa01. This is a longer function name than we’ve been using, for  \\na good reason. First, test functions need to start with the word test,  \\nfollowed by an underscore. Any function that starts with test_ will be  \\ndiscovered  by pytest, and will be run as part of the testing process.\\nAlso, test names should be longer and more descriptive than a typical \\nfunction name. You’ll never call the function yourself; pytest will find the \\nfunction and run it for you. Test function names should be long enough \\nthat if you see the function name in a test report, you’ll have a good sense \\nof what behavior was being tested.\\nNext, we call the function we’re testing\\xa02. Here we call get_formatted \\n_name() with the arguments \\'janis\\' and \\'joplin\\', just like we used when we \\nran names.py. We assign the return value of this function to formatted_name.\\nFinally, we make an assertion\\xa0 3. An assertion is a claim about a condi-\\ntion. Here we’re claiming that the value of formatted_name should be \\'Janis \\nJoplin\\'.\\nRunning a Test\\nIf you run the file test_name_function.py  directly, you won’t get any output \\nbecause we never called the test function. Instead, we’ll have pytest run the \\ntest file for us.\\nTo do this, open a terminal window and navigate to the folder that con-\\ntains the test file. If you’re using VS Code, you can open the folder containing \\nthe test file and use the terminal that’s embedded in the editor window. In the \\nterminal window, enter the command pytest. Here’s what you should see:\\n$ pytest\\n========================= test session starts =========================\\n1 platform darwin -- Python 3.x.x, pytest-7.x.x, pluggy-1.x.x\\n2 rootdir: /.../python_work/chapter_11\\n3 collected 1 item\\n4 test_name_function.py .

When we modify get_formatted_name(), we can run this test again. If the \\ntest passes, we know the function will still work for names like Janis Joplin.\\nNOTE  If you’re not sure how to navigate to the right location in the terminal, see “Running \\nPython Programs from a Terminal” on page 11. Also, if you see a message that the \\npytest command was not found, use the command python -m pytest instead.\\nA Failing Test\\nWhat does a failing test look like? Let’s modify get_formatted_name() so it can \\nhandle middle names, but let’s do so in a way that breaks the function for \\nnames with just a first and last name, like Janis Joplin.\\nHere’s a new version of get_formatted_name() that requires a middle name \\nargument:\\nname \\n_function.py\\ndef get_formatted_name(first, middle, last):\\n    \"\"\"Generate a neatly formatted full name.\"\"\"\\n    full_name = f\"{first} {middle} {last}\"\\n    return full_name.title()\\nThis version should work for people with middle names, but when we \\ntest it, we see that we’ve broken the function for people with just a first and \\nlast name.\\nThis time, running pytest gives the following output:\\n$ pytest\\n========================= test session starts =========================\\n--snip--\\n1 test_name_function.py F                                          [100%]\\n2 ============================== FAILURES ===============================\\n3 ________________________ test_first_last_name _________________________\\n    def test_first_last_name():\\n        \"\"\"Do names like \\'Janis Joplin\\' work?\"\"\"\\n4 >       formatted_name = get_formatted_name(\\'janis\\', \\'joplin\\')\\n5 E       TypeError: get_formatted_name() missing 1 required positional\\n            argument: \\'last\\''),\n",

The first item of note in the output is a single \\nF\\xa01, which tells us that one test failed. We then see a section that focuses \\non FAILURES\\xa02, because failed tests are usually the most important thing to \\nfocus on in a test run. Next, we see that test_first_last_name() was the test \\nfunction that failed\\xa0 3. An angle bracket\\xa04 indicates the line of code that \\ncaused the test to fail. The E on the next line\\xa05 shows the actual error that \\ncaused the failure: a TypeError due to a missing required positional argument, \\nlast. The most important information is repeated in a shorter summary at \\nthe end, so when you’re running many tests, you can get a quick sense of \\nwhich tests failed and why.\\nResponding to a Failed Test\\nWhat do you do when a test fails? Assuming you’re checking the right condi -\\ntions, a passing test means the function is behaving correctly and a failing \\ntest means there’s an error in the new code you wrote. So when a test fails, \\ndon’t change the test. If you do, your tests might pass, but any code that \\ncalls your function like the test does will suddenly stop working. Instead, \\nfix the code that’s causing the test to fail. Examine the changes you just \\nmade to the function, and figure out how those changes broke the desired \\nbehavior.\\nIn this case, get_formatted_name() used to require only two parameters: a \\nfirst name and a last name. Now it requires a first name, middle name, and \\nlast name. The addition of that mandatory middle name parameter broke \\nthe original behavior of get_formatted_name() . The best option here is to \\nmake the middle name optional. Once we do, our test for names like Janis \\nJoplin should pass again, and we should be able to accept middle names as \\nwell. Let’s modify get_formatted_name() so middle names are optional and \\nthen run the test case again. If it passes, we’ll move on to making sure the \\nfunction handles middle names properly.\\nTo make middle names optional, we move the parameter middle to the \\nend of the parameter list in the function definition and give it an empty \\ndefault value. We also add an if test that builds the full name properly, \\ndepending on whether a middle name is provided:\\nname \\n_function.py\\ndef get_formatted_name(first, last, middle=\\'\\'):\\n    \"\"\"Generate a neatly formatted full name.\"\"\"\\n    if middle:\\n        full_name = f\"{first} {middle} {last}\"\\n    else:\\n        full_name = f\"{first} {last}\"\\n    return full_name.title()'),\n",

Otherwise, the full name will consist of just a first \\nand last name. Now the function should work for both kinds of names. To \\nfind out if the function still works for names like Janis Joplin, let’s run the \\ntest again:\\n$ pytest\\n========================= test session starts =========================\\n--snip--\\ntest_name_function.py .

This is ideal; it means the function works for \\nnames like Janis Joplin again, without us having to test the function \\nmanually. Fixing our function was easier because the failed test helped \\nus identify how the new code broke existing behavior.\\nAdding New Tests\\nNow that we know get_formatted_name() works for simple names again, let’s \\nwrite a second test for people who include a middle name.

The function \\nname must start with test_ so the function runs automatically when we run \\npytest. We name the function to make it clear which behavior of get_formatted \\n_name() we’re testing. As a result, if the test fails, we’ll know right away what \\nkinds of names are affected.\\nTo test the function, we call get_formatted_name() with a first, last, and \\nmiddle name\\xa01, and then we make an assertion\\xa0 2 that the returned full \\nname matches the full name (first, middle, and last) that we expect.

Consider a class that helps \\nadminister anonymous surveys:\\nsurvey.py class AnonymousSurvey:\\n    \"\"\"Collect anonymous answers to a survey question.\"\"\"\\n1     def __init__(self, question):\\n        \"\"\"Store a question, and prepare to store responses.\"\"\"\\n        self.question = question\\n        self.responses = []\\n2     def show_question(self):\\n        \"\"\"Show the survey question.\"\"\"\\n        print(self.question)\\n3     def store_response(self, new_response):\\n        \"\"\"Store a single response to the survey.\"\"\"\\n        self.responses.append(new_response)\\n4     def show_results(self):\\n        \"\"\"Show all the responses that have been given.\"\"\"\\n        print(\"Survey results:\")\\n        for response in self.responses:\\n            print(f\"- {response}\")\\nThis class starts with a survey question that you provide\\xa0 1 and includes \\nan empty list to store responses.

Once you have an instance representing a par -\\nticular survey, you display the survey question with show_question(), store a \\nresponse using store_response(), and show results with show_results().\\nTo show that the AnonymousSurvey class works, let’s write a program that \\nuses the class:\\nlanguage \\n_survey.py\\nfrom survey import AnonymousSurvey\\n# Define a question, and make a survey.\\nquestion = \"What language did you first learn to speak?\"\\nlanguage_survey = AnonymousSurvey(question)\\n# Show the question, and store responses to the question.\\nlanguage_survey.show_question()\\nprint(\"Enter \\'q\\' at any time to quit.\\\\n\")\\nwhile True:\\n    response = input(\"Language: \")\\n    if response == \\'q\\':\\n        break\\n    language_survey.store_response(response)\\n# Show the survey results.\\nprint(\"\\\\nThank you to everyone who participated in the survey!\")\\nlanguage_survey.show_results()\\nThis program defines a question (\"What language did you first learn to \\nspeak?\") and creates an AnonymousSurvey object with that question. The program \\ncalls show_question() to display the question and then prompts for responses. \\nEach response is stored as it is received. When all responses have been entered \\n(the user inputs q to quit), show_results() prints the survey results:\\nWhat language did you first learn to speak?\\nEnter \\'q\\' at any time to quit.\\nLanguage: English\\nLanguage: Spanish\\nLanguage: English\\nLanguage: Mandarin\\nLanguage: q\\nThank you to everyone who participated in the survey!\\nSurvey results:\\n- English\\n- Spanish\\n- English\\n- Mandarin\\nThis class works for a simple anonymous survey, but say we want to \\nimprove AnonymousSurvey and the module it’s in, survey. We could allow  \\neach user to enter more than one response, we could write a method to \\nlist only unique responses and to report how many times each response \\nwas given, or we could even write another class to manage non-anonymous \\nsurveys.'),\n",

For example, it’s possible that while trying to \\nallow each user to enter multiple responses, we could accidentally change \\nhow single responses are handled. To ensure we don’t break existing behav-\\nior as we develop this module, we can write tests for the class.\\nTesting the AnonymousSurvey Class\\nLet’s write a test that verifies one aspect of the way AnonymousSurvey behaves. \\nWe’ll write a test to verify that a single response to the survey question is \\nstored properly:\\ntest_survey.py from survey import AnonymousSurvey\\n1 def test_store_single_response():\\n    \"\"\"Test that a single response is stored properly.\"\"\"\\n    question = \"What language did you first learn to speak?\"\\n2     language_survey = AnonymousSurvey(question)\\n    language_survey.store_response(\\'English\\')\\n3     assert \\'English\\' in language_survey.responses\\nWe start by importing the class we want to test, AnonymousSurvey. The \\nfirst test function will verify that when we store a response to the survey \\nquestion, the response will end up in the survey’s list of responses. A good \\ndescriptive name for this function is test_store_single_response()\\xa01. If this \\ntest fails, we’ll know from the function name in the test summary that there \\nwas a problem storing a single response to the survey.\\nTo test the behavior of a class, we need to make an instance of the \\nclass. We create an instance called language_survey\\xa02 with the question  \\n\"What language did you first learn to speak?\"  We store a single response, \\nEnglish, using the store_response() method. Then we verify that the response \\nwas stored correctly by asserting that English is in the list language_survey \\n.responses\\xa03.\\nBy default, running the command pytest with no arguments will run all \\nthe tests that pytest discovers in the current directory. To focus on the tests \\nin one file, pass the name of the test file you want to run. Here we’ll run \\njust the one test we wrote for AnonymousSurvey:\\n$ pytest test_survey.py\\n========================= test session starts =========================\\n--snip--\\ntest_survey.py .

We create a sur-\\nvey object just like we did in test_store_single_response().

Once the responses have been stored, we \\nwrite another loop and assert that each response is now in language_survey \\n.responses\\xa02.\\nWhen we run the test file again, both tests (for a single response and \\nfor three responses) pass:\\n$ pytest test_survey.py\\n========================= test session starts =========================\\n--snip--\\ntest_survey.py ..

However, these tests are a bit repetitive, so we’ll \\nuse another feature of pytest to make them more efficient.\\nUsing Fixtures\\nIn test_survey.py , we created a new instance of AnonymousSurvey in each test \\nfunction. This is fine in the short example we’re working with, but in a real-\\nworld project with tens or hundreds of tests, this would be problematic.\\nIn testing, a fixture helps set up a test environment. Often, this means \\ncreating a resource that’s used by more than one test. We create a fixture in \\npytest by writing a function with the decorator @pytest.fixture. A decorator is \\na directive placed just before a function definition; Python applies this direc-\\ntive to the function before it runs, to alter how the function code behaves. \\nDon’t worry if this sounds complicated; you can start to use decorators from \\nthird-party packages before learning to write them yourself.\\nLet’s use a fixture to create a single survey instance that can be used in \\nboth test functions in test_survey.py :\\nimport pytest\\nfrom survey import AnonymousSurvey\\n1 @pytest.fixture\\n2 def language_survey():\\n    \"\"\"A survey that will be available to all test functions.\"\"\"'),\n",

We apply the @pytest.fixture decorator\\xa01 to the new func-\\ntion language_survey()\\xa02. This function builds an AnonymousSurvey object and \\nreturns the new survey.\\nNotice that the definitions of both test functions have changed\\xa0 3\\xa05; \\neach test function now has a parameter called language_survey. When  \\na parameter in a test function matches the name of a function with the  \\n@pytest.fixture decorator, the fixture will be run automatically and  \\nthe return value will be passed to the test function. In this example, the \\nfunction language_survey() supplies both test_store_single_response() and \\ntest_store_three_responses() with a language_survey instance.\\nThere’s no new code in either of the test functions, but notice that two \\nlines have been removed from each function\\xa04\\xa06: the line that defined a \\nquestion and the line that created an AnonymousSurvey object.\\nWhen we run the test file again, both tests still pass. These tests would \\nbe particularly useful when trying to expand AnonymousSurvey to handle \\nmultiple responses for each person. After modifying the code to accept \\nmultiple responses, you could run these tests and make sure you haven’t \\naffected the ability to store a single response or a series of individual \\nresponses.\\nThe structure above will almost certainly look complicated; it contains \\nsome of the most abstract code you’ve seen so far. You don’t need to use \\nfixtures right away; it’s better to write tests that have a lot of repetitive code \\nthan to write no tests at all. Just know that when you’ve written enough \\ntests that the repetition is getting in the way, there’s a well-established way \\nto deal with the repetition. Also, fixtures in simple examples like this one \\ndon’t really make the code any shorter or simpler to follow. But in projects \\nwith many tests, or in situations where it takes many lines to build a resource \\nthat’s used in multiple tests, fixtures can drastically improve your test code.\\nWhen you want to write a fixture, write a function that generates the \\nresource that’s used by multiple test functions. Add the @pytest.fixture'),\n",

The __init__() method should \\ntake in a first name, a last name, and an annual salary, and store each of these \\nas attributes. Write a method called give_raise() that adds $5,000 to the \\nannual salary by default but also accepts a different raise amount.\\nWrite a test file for Employee with two test functions, test_give_default \\n_raise() and test_give_custom_raise(). Write your tests once without using a \\nfixture, and make sure they both pass. Then write a fixture so you don’t have to \\ncreate a new employee instance in each test function. Run the tests again, and \\nmake sure both tests still pass.\\nSummary\\nIn this chapter, you learned to write tests for functions and classes using \\ntools in the pytest module. You learned to write test functions that verify \\nspecific behaviors your functions and classes should exhibit. You saw how \\nfixtures can be used to efficiently create resources that can be used in mul -\\ntiple test functions in a test file.\\nTesting is an important topic that many newer programmers aren’t \\nexposed to. You don’t have to write tests for all the simple projects you try \\nas a new programmer. But as soon as you start to work on projects that \\ninvolve significant development effort, you should test the critical behaviors \\nof your functions and classes. You’ll be more confident that new work on \\nyour project won’t break the parts that work, and this will give you the free -\\ndom to make improvements to your code. If you accidentally break existing \\nfunctionality, you’ll know right away, so you can still fix the problem easily. \\nResponding to a failed test that you ran is much easier than responding to a \\nbug report from an unhappy user.\\nOther programmers will respect your projects more if you include some \\ninitial tests. They’ll feel more comfortable experimenting with your code \\nand be more willing to work with you on projects. If you want to contribute \\nto a project that other programmers are working on, you’ll be expected to \\nshow that your code passes existing tests and you’ll usually be expected  \\nto write tests for any new behavior you introduce to the project.\\nPlay around with tests to become familiar with the process of testing \\nyour code. Write tests for the most critical behaviors of your functions and \\nclasses, but don’t aim for full coverage in early projects unless you have a \\nspecific reason to do so.'),\n",

It’s \\ndeeply satisfying to play a game you wrote, and writing a simple game will \\nteach you a lot about how professionals develop games. As you work through \\nthis chapter, enter and run the code to identify how each code block contrib-\\nutes to overall gameplay.

Be sure to save all files for the project to this folder so your \\nimport statements will work correctly.\\nAlso, if you feel comfortable using version control, you might want to use it \\nfor this project. If you haven’t used version control before, see Appendix D for an \\noverview.\\nPlanning Your Project\\nWhen you’re building a large project, it’s important to prepare a plan before \\nyou begin to write code. Your plan will keep you focused and make it more \\nlikely that you’ll complete the project.\\nLet’s write a description of the general gameplay. Although the following \\ndescription doesn’t cover every detail of Alien Invasion, it provides a clear idea \\nof how to start building the game:\\nIn Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears \\nat the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship \\nright and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the \\nspacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky \\nand moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and \\ndestroys the aliens. If the player destroys all the aliens, a new fleet \\nappears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits \\nthe player’s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player \\nloses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.\\nFor the first development phase, we’ll make a ship that can move right \\nand left when the player presses the arrow keys and fire bullets when the \\nplayer presses the spacebar. After setting up this behavior, we can create the \\naliens and refine the gameplay.\\nInstalling Pygame\\nBefore you begin coding, install Pygame. We’ll do this the same way we \\ninstalled pytest in Chapter\\xa011: with pip. If you skipped Chapter\\xa011 or need a \\nrefresher on pip, see “Installing pytest with pip ” on page 210.\\nTo install Pygame, enter the following command at a terminal prompt:\\n$ python -m pip install --user pygame\\nIf you use a command other than python to run programs or start a ter -\\nminal session, such as python3, make sure you use that command instead.'),\n",

Later, \\nwe’ll draw the game elements, such as the ship and the aliens, on this win -\\ndow. We’ll also make our game respond to user input, set the background \\ncolor, and load a ship image.\\nCreating a Pygame Window and Responding to User Input\\nWe’ll make an empty Pygame window by creating a class to represent the \\ngame. In your text editor, create a new file and save it as alien_invasion.py; \\nthen enter the following:\\nalien \\n_invasion.py\\nimport sys\\nimport pygame\\nclass AlienInvasion:\\n    \"\"\"Overall class to manage game assets and behavior.\"\"\"\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        \"\"\"Initialize the game, and create game resources.\"\"\"\\n1         pygame.init()\\n2         self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((1200, 800))\\n        pygame.display.set_caption(\"Alien Invasion\")\\n    def run_game(self):\\n        \"\"\"Start the main loop for the game.\"\"\"\\n3         while True:\\n            # Watch for keyboard and mouse events.\\n4             for event in pygame.event.get():\\n5                 if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\\n                    sys.exit()\\n            # Make the most recently drawn screen visible.\\n6             pygame.display.flip()\\nif __name__ == \\'__main__\\':\\n    # Make a game instance, and run the game.\\n    ai = AlienInvasion()\\n    ai.run_game()\\nFirst, we import the sys and pygame modules. The pygame module con-\\ntains the functionality we need to make a game. We’ll use tools in the sys \\nmodule to exit the game when the player quits.\\nAlien Invasion  starts as a class called AlienInvasion. In the __init__() \\nmethod, the pygame.init() function initializes the background settings that \\nPygame needs to work properly\\xa01. Then we call pygame.display.set_mode() \\nto create a display window\\xa02, on which we’ll draw all the game’s graphical \\nelements. The argument (1200, 800) is a tuple that defines the dimensions \\nof the game window, which will be 1,200 pixels wide by 800 pixels high. \\n(You can adjust these values depending on your display size.) We assign this'),\n",

A surface in \\nPygame is a part of the screen where a game element can be displayed. Each \\nelement in the game, like an alien or a ship, is its own surface. The surface \\nreturned by display.set_mode() represents the entire game window. When we \\nactivate the game’s animation loop, this surface will be redrawn on every \\npass through the loop, so it can be updated with any changes triggered by \\nuser input.\\nThe game is controlled by the run_game() method. This method contains \\na while loop\\xa03 that runs continually. The while loop contains an event loop \\nand code that manages screen updates. An event is an action that the user per-\\nforms while playing the game, such as pressing a key or moving the mouse. To \\nmake our program respond to events, we write an event loop to listen for events \\nand perform appropriate tasks depending on the kinds of events that occur. \\nThe for loop\\xa04 nested inside the while loop is an event loop.\\nTo access the events that Pygame detects, we’ll use the pygame.event.get() \\nfunction. This function returns a list of events that have taken place since \\nthe last time this function was called. Any keyboard or mouse event will \\ncause this for loop to run. Inside the loop, we’ll write a series of if state -\\nments to detect and respond to specific events. For example, when the \\nplayer clicks the game window’s close button, a pygame.QUIT event is detected \\nand we call sys.exit() to exit the game\\xa05.\\nThe call to pygame.display.flip() \\xa06 tells Pygame to make the most \\nrecently drawn screen visible. In this case, it simply draws an empty screen \\non each pass through the while loop, erasing the old screen so only the new \\nscreen is visible. When we move the game elements around, pygame.display \\n.flip() continually updates the display to show the new positions of game \\nelements and hide the old ones, creating the illusion of smooth movement.\\nAt the end of the file, we create an instance of the game and then call \\nrun_game(). We place run_game() in an if block that only runs if the file is \\ncalled directly. When you run this alien_invasion.py file, you should see an \\nempty Pygame window.\\nControlling the Frame Rate\\nIdeally, games should run at the same speed, or frame rate , on all systems. \\nControlling the frame rate of a game that can run on multiple systems is \\na complex issue, but Pygame offers a relatively simple way to accomplish \\nthis goal. We’ll make a clock, and ensure the clock ticks once on each pass \\nthrough the main loop. Anytime the loop processes faster than the rate we \\ndefine, Pygame will calculate the correct amount of time to pause so that \\nthe game runs at a consistent rate.\\nWe’ll define the clock in the __init__() method:\\nalien_invasion.py     def __init__(self):\\n        \"\"\"Initialize the game, and create game resources.\"\"\"\\n        pygame.init()'),\n",

If it makes the \\ngame run less consistently on your system, you can try different values for the frame \\nrate. If you can’t find a good frame rate on your system, you can leave the clock out \\nentirely and adjust the game’s settings so it runs well on your system.\\nSetting the Background Color\\nPygame creates a black screen by default, but that’s boring. Let’s set a differ -\\nent background color. We’ll do this at the end of the __init__() method.\\nalien \\n_invasion.py\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        --snip--\\n        pygame.display.set_caption(\"Alien Invasion\")\\n        # Set the background color.\\n1         self.bg_color = (230, 230, 230)\\n    def run_game(self):\\n        --snip--\\n            for event in pygame.event.get():\\n                if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\\n                    sys.exit()\\n            # Redraw the screen during each pass through the loop.\\n2             self.screen.fill(self.bg_color)\\n            # Make the most recently drawn screen visible.\\n            pygame.display.flip()\\n            self.clock.tick(60)\\nColors in Pygame are specified as RGB colors: a mix of red, green, and \\nblue. Each color value can range from 0 to 255. The color value (255, 0, 0) \\nis red, (0, 255, 0) is green, and (0, 0, 255) is blue. You can mix different \\nRGB values to create up to 16 million colors.

We assign this color to self.bg_color\\xa01.\\nWe fill the screen with the background color using the fill() method\\xa02, \\nwhich acts on a surface and takes only one argument: a color.\\nCreating a Settings Class\\nEach time we introduce new functionality into the game, we’ll typically \\ncreate some new settings as well. Instead of adding settings throughout the \\ncode, let’s write a module called settings that contains a class called Settings \\nto store all these values in one place. This approach allows us to work with \\njust one settings object anytime we need to access an individual setting. \\nThis also makes it easier to modify the game’s appearance and behavior as \\nour project grows. To modify the game, we’ll change the relevant values in \\nsettings.py, which we’ll create next, instead of searching for different settings \\nthroughout the project.\\nCreate a new file named settings.py inside your alien_invasion folder, and \\nadd this initial Settings class:\\nsettings.py class Settings:\\n    \"\"\"A class to store all settings for Alien Invasion.\"\"\"\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        \"\"\"Initialize the game\\'s settings.\"\"\"\\n        # Screen settings\\n        self.screen_width = 1200\\n        self.screen_height = 800\\n        self.bg_color = (230, 230, 230)\\nTo make an instance of Settings in the project and use it to access our \\nsettings, we need to modify alien_invasion.py as follows:\\nalien \\n_invasion.py\\n--snip--\\nimport pygame\\nfrom settings import Settings\\nclass AlienInvasion:\\n    \"\"\"Overall class to manage game assets and behavior.\"\"\"\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        \"\"\"Initialize the game, and create game resources.\"\"\"\\n        pygame.init()\\n        self.clock = pygame.time.Clock()\\n1         self.settings = Settings()\\n2         self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode(\\n            (self.settings.screen_width, self.settings.screen_height))\\n        pygame.display.set_caption(\"Alien Invasion\")'),\n",

To draw the player’s ship on the screen, \\nwe’ll load an image and then use the Pygame blit() method to draw the \\nimage.\\nWhen you’re choosing artwork for your games, be sure to pay atten -\\ntion to licensing. The safest and cheapest way to start is to use freely \\nlicensed graphics that you can use and modify, from a website like https://\\nopengameart.org .\\nYou can use almost any type of image file in your game, but it’s easiest \\nwhen you use a bitmap (.bmp) file because Pygame loads bitmaps by default. \\nAlthough you can configure Pygame to use other file types, some file types \\ndepend on certain image libraries that must be installed on your computer. \\nMost images you’ll find are in .jpg or .png formats, but you can convert them \\nto bitmaps using tools like Photoshop, GIMP, and Paint.\\nPay particular attention to the background color in your chosen \\nimage. Try to find a file with a transparent or solid background that you \\ncan replace with any background color, using an image editor. Your games \\nwill look best if the image’s background color matches your game’s back -\\nground color. Alternatively, you can match your game’s background to the \\nimage’s background.\\nFor Alien Invasion, you can use the file ship.bmp (Figure\\xa012-1), which is \\navailable in this book’s resources at https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e. The \\nfile’s background color matches the settings we’re using in this project. \\nMake a folder called images inside your main alien_invasion project folder. \\nSave the file ship.bmp in the images folder.'),\n",

To \\nuse our ship, we’ll create a new ship module that will contain the class Ship. \\nThis class will manage most of the behavior of the player’s ship:\\nship.py import pygame\\nclass Ship:\\n    \"\"\"A class to manage the ship.\"\"\"\\n    def __init__(self, ai_game):\\n        \"\"\"Initialize the ship and set its starting position.\"\"\"\\n1         self.screen = ai_game.screen\\n2         self.screen_rect = ai_game.screen.get_rect()\\n        # Load the ship image and get its rect.\\n3         self.image = pygame.image.load(\\'images/ship.bmp\\')\\n        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()\\n        # Start each new ship at the bottom center of the screen.\\n4         self.rect.midbottom = self.screen_rect.midbottom\\n5     def blitme(self):\\n        \"\"\"Draw the ship at its current location.\"\"\"\\n        self.screen.blit(self.image, self.rect)\\nPygame is efficient because it lets you treat all game elements like rect -\\nangles (rects), even if they’re not exactly shaped like rectangles. Treating an \\nelement as a rectangle is efficient because rectangles are simple geometric \\nshapes. When Pygame needs to figure out whether two game elements have \\ncollided, for example, it can do this more quickly if it treats each object as a \\nrectangle. This approach usually works well enough that no one playing the'),\n",

We’ll treat the ship and the screen as rectangles in this class.\\nWe import the pygame module before defining the class. The __init__() \\nmethod of Ship takes two parameters: the self reference and a reference to \\nthe current instance of the AlienInvasion class. This will give Ship access to \\nall the game resources defined in AlienInvasion. We then assign the screen \\nto an attribute of Ship\\xa01, so we can access it easily in all the methods in this \\nclass. We access the screen’s rect attribute using the get_rect() method and \\nassign it to self.screen_rect\\xa02. Doing so allows us to place the ship in the \\ncorrect location on the screen.\\nTo load the image, we call pygame.image.load()\\xa03 and give it the location \\nof our ship image. This function returns a surface representing the ship, \\nwhich we assign to self.image. When the image is loaded, we call get_rect() to \\naccess the ship surface’s rect attribute so we can later use it to place the ship.\\nWhen you’re working with a rect object, you can use the x- and \\ny-coordinates of the top, bottom, left, and right edges of the rectangle, as \\nwell as the center, to place the object. You can set any of these values to \\nestablish the current position of the rect. When you’re centering a game \\nelement, work with the center, centerx, or centery attributes of a rect. When \\nyou’re working at an edge of the screen, work with the top, bottom, left, or \\nright attributes. There are also attributes that combine these properties, \\nsuch as midbottom, midtop, midleft, and midright. When you’re adjusting the \\nhorizontal or vertical placement of the rect, you can just use the x and y \\nattributes, which are the x- and y-coordinates of its top-left corner. These \\nattributes spare you from having to do calculations that game developers \\nformerly had to do manually, and you’ll use them often.\\nNOTE  In Pygame, the origin (0, 0) is at the top-left corner of the screen, and coordinates \\nincrease as you go down and to the right. On a 1200×800 screen, the origin is at the \\ntop-left corner, and the bottom-right corner has the coordinates (1200, 800). These \\ncoordinates refer to the game window, not the physical screen.\\nWe’ll position the ship at the bottom center of the screen. To do so, \\nmake the value of self.rect.midbottom match the midbottom attribute of the \\nscreen’s rect\\xa04. Pygame uses these rect attributes to position the ship image \\nso it’s centered horizontally and aligned with the bottom of the screen.\\nFinally, we define the blitme() method\\xa05, which draws the image to the \\nscreen at the position specified by self.rect.\\nDrawing the Ship to the Screen\\nNow let’s update alien_invasion.py so it creates a ship and calls the ship’s \\nblitme() method:\\nalien \\n_invasion.py\\n--snip--\\nfrom settings import Settings\\nfrom ship import Ship'),\n",

Refactoring simplifies the structure of the code you’ve already \\nwritten, making it easier to build on. In this section, we’ll break the run_game() \\nmethod, which is getting lengthy, into two helper methods. A helper method \\ndoes work inside a class but isn’t meant to be used by code outside the class. \\nIn Python, a single leading underscore indicates a helper method.\\nThe _check_events() Method\\nWe’ll move the code that manages events to a separate method called \\n_check_events(). This will simplify run_game() and isolate the event manage-\\nment loop. Isolating the event loop allows you to manage events separately \\nfrom other aspects of the game, such as updating the screen.\\nHere’s the AlienInvasion class with the new _check_events() method, \\nwhich only affects the code in run_game():\\nalien \\n_invasion.py\\n    def run_game(self):\\n        \"\"\"Start the main loop for the game.\"\"\"\\n        while True:\\n1             self._check_events()\\n            # Redraw the screen during each pass through the loop.\\n            --snip--\\n2     def _check_events(self):\\n        \"\"\"Respond to keypresses and mouse events.\"\"\"\\n        for event in pygame.event.get():\\n            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\\n                sys.exit()\\nWe make a new _check_events() method\\xa02 and move the lines that check \\nwhether the player has clicked to close the window into this new method.\\nTo call a method from within a class, use dot notation with the variable \\nself and the name of the method\\xa0 1.

But if you’ve never tackled a \\nproject like this, you probably won’t know exactly how to structure your \\ncode at first. This approach gives you an idea of a realistic development pro -\\ncess: you start out writing your code as simply as possible, and then refactor \\nit as your project becomes more complex.\\nNow that we’ve restructured the code to make it easier to add to, we can \\nwork on the dynamic aspects of the game!\\nTRY IT YOURSELF\\n12-1.

We’ll have the game detect a \\npygame.KEYUP event so we’ll know when the right arrow key is released; then \\nwe’ll use the KEYDOWN and KEYUP events together with a flag called moving_right \\nto implement continuous motion.\\nWhen the moving_right flag is False, the ship will be motionless. When \\nthe player presses the right arrow key, we’ll set the flag to True, and when the \\nplayer releases the key, we’ll set the flag to False again.\\nThe Ship class controls all attributes of the ship, so we’ll give it an attri -\\nbute called moving_right and an update() method to check the status of the \\nmoving_right flag.

Using two if blocks makes the \\nmovements more accurate when the player might momentarily hold down \\nboth keys when changing directions.\\nWe have to make two additions to _check_events():\\nalien_invasion.py     def _check_events(self):\\n        \"\"\"Respond to keypresses and mouse events.\"\"\"\\n        for event in pygame.event.get():\\n            --snip--\\n            elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:\\n                if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:\\n                    self.ship.moving_right = True\\n                elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:\\n                    self.ship.moving_left = True\\n            elif event.type == pygame.KEYUP:\\n                if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:\\n                    self.ship.moving_right = False\\n                elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:\\n                    self.ship.moving_left = False\\nIf a KEYDOWN event occurs for the K_LEFT key, we set moving_left to True.

Let’s adjust the ship’s \\nspeed and limit how far the ship can move so it can’t disappear off the sides \\nof the screen.\\nAdjusting the Ship’s Speed\\nCurrently, the ship moves one pixel per cycle through the while loop, but we \\ncan take finer control of the ship’s speed by adding a ship_speed attribute to \\nthe Settings class. We’ll use this attribute to determine how far to move the \\nship on each pass through the loop. Here’s the new attribute in settings.py:\\nsettings.py class Settings:\\n    \"\"\"A class to store all settings for Alien Invasion.\"\"\"\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        --snip--\\n        # Ship settings\\n        self.ship_speed = 1.5\\nWe set the initial value of ship_speed to 1.5. When the ship moves now, \\nits position is adjusted by 1.5 pixels (rather than 1 pixel) on each pass \\nthrough the loop.\\nWe’re using a float for the speed setting to give us finer control of the \\nship’s speed when we increase the tempo of the game later on. However, \\nrect attributes such as x store only integer values, so we need to make some \\nmodifications to Ship:\\nship.py class Ship:\\n    \"\"\"A class to manage the ship.\"\"\"\\n    def __init__(self, ai_game):\\n        \"\"\"Initialize the ship and set its starting position.\"\"\"\\n        self.screen = ai_game.screen\\n1         self.settings = ai_game.settings\\n        --snip--\\n        # Start each new ship at the bottom center of the screen.\\n        self.rect.midbottom = self.screen_rect.midbottom\\n        # Store a float for the ship\\'s exact horizontal position.\\n2         self.x = float(self.rect.x)\\n        # Movement flags; start with a ship that\\'s not moving.\\n        self.moving_right = False\\n        self.moving_left = False\\n    def update(self):\\n        \"\"\"Update the ship\\'s position based on movement flags.\"\"\"\\n        # Update the ship\\'s x value, not the rect.\\n        if self.moving_right:\\n3             self.x += self.settings.ship_speed'),\n",

To keep track of the ship’s position accu-\\nrately, we define a new self.x\\xa02. We use the float() function to convert the \\nvalue of self.rect.x to a float and assign this value to self.x.\\nNow when we change the ship’s position in update(), the value of self.x \\nis adjusted by the amount stored in settings.ship_speed \\xa03. After self.x \\nhas been updated, we use the new value to update self.rect.x, which con-\\ntrols the position of the ship\\xa04. Only the integer portion of self.x will be \\nassigned to self.rect.x, but that’s fine for displaying the ship.\\nNow we can change the value of ship_speed, and any value greater than 1  \\nwill make the ship move faster. This will help make the ship respond \\nquickly enough to shoot down aliens, and it will let us change the tempo  \\nof the game as the player progresses in gameplay.\\nLimiting the Ship’s Range\\nAt this point, the ship will disappear off either edge of the screen if you \\nhold down an arrow key long enough. Let’s correct this so the ship stops \\nmoving when it reaches the screen’s edge. We do this by modifying the \\nupdate() method in Ship:\\nship.py     def update(self):\\n        \"\"\"Update the ship\\'s position based on movement flags.\"\"\"\\n        # Update the ship\\'s x value, not the rect.\\n1         if self.moving_right and self.rect.right < self.screen_rect.right:\\n            self.x += self.settings.ship_speed\\n2         if self.moving_left and self.rect.left > 0:\\n            self.x -= self.settings.ship_speed\\n        # Update rect object from self.x.\\n        self.rect.x = self.x\\nThis code checks the position of the ship before changing the value of \\nself.x. The code self.rect.right returns the x-coordinate of the right edge \\nof the ship’s rect. If this value is less than the value returned by self.screen \\n_rect.right, the ship hasn’t reached the right edge of the screen\\xa01. The same \\ngoes for the left edge: if the value of the left side of the rect is greater than 0, \\nthe ship hasn’t reached the left edge of the screen\\xa02. This ensures the ship \\nis within these bounds before adjusting the value of self.x.'),\n",

This is pretty cool; all we’ve done is add a con -\\nditional test in an if statement, but it feels like the ship hits a wall or force \\nfield at either edge of the screen!\\nRefactoring _check_events()\\nThe _check_events() method will increase in length as we continue to \\ndevelop the game, so let’s break _check_events() into two separate methods: \\none that handles KEYDOWN events and another that handles KEYUP events:\\nalien_invasion.py     def _check_events(self):\\n        \"\"\"Respond to keypresses and mouse events.\"\"\"\\n        for event in pygame.event.get():\\n            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\\n                sys.exit()\\n            elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:\\n                self._check_keydown_events(event)\\n            elif event.type == pygame.KEYUP:\\n                self._check_keyup_events(event)\\n    def _check_keydown_events(self, event):\\n        \"\"\"Respond to keypresses.\"\"\"\\n        if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:\\n            self.ship.moving_right = True\\n        elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:\\n            self.ship.moving_left = True\\n    def _check_keyup_events(self, event):\\n        \"\"\"Respond to key releases.\"\"\"\\n        if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:\\n            self.ship.moving_right = False\\n        elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:\\n            self.ship.moving_left = False\\nWe make two new helper methods: _check_keydown_events() and _check \\n_keyup_events(). Each needs a self parameter and an event parameter. The \\nbodies of these two methods are copied from _check_events(), and we’ve \\nreplaced the old code with calls to the new methods. The _check_events() \\nmethod is simpler now with this cleaner code structure, which will make it \\neasier to develop further responses to player input.\\nPressing Q to Quit\\nNow that we’re responding to keypresses efficiently, we can add another \\nway to quit the game. It gets tedious to click the X at the top of the game \\nwindow to end the game every time you test a new feature, so we’ll add a \\nkeyboard shortcut to end the game when the player presses Q:\\nalien_invasion.py     def _check_keydown_events(self, event):\\n        --snip--\\n        elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:'),\n",

Now, when testing, you can press Q to close the game \\ninstead of using your cursor to close the window.\\nRunning the Game in Fullscreen Mode\\nPygame has a fullscreen mode that you might like better than running \\nthe game in a regular window. Some games look better in fullscreen \\nmode, and on some systems, the game may perform better overall in \\nfullscreen mode.\\nTo run the game in fullscreen mode, make the following changes in \\n__init__():\\nalien \\n_invasion.py\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        \"\"\"Initialize the game, and create game resources.\"\"\"\\n        pygame.init()\\n        self.settings = Settings()\\n1         self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((0, 0), pygame.FULLSCREEN)\\n2         self.settings.screen_width = self.screen.get_rect().width\\n        self.settings.screen_height = self.screen.get_rect().height\\n        pygame.display.set_caption(\"Alien Invasion\")\\nWhen creating the screen surface, we pass a size of (0, 0) and the \\nparameter pygame.FULLSCREEN\\xa01. This tells Pygame to figure out a window \\nsize that will fill the screen. Because we don’t know the width and height of \\nthe screen ahead of time, we update these settings after the screen is cre -\\nated\\xa02. We use the width and height attributes of the screen’s rect to update \\nthe settings object.\\nIf you like how the game looks or behaves in fullscreen mode, keep \\nthese settings. If you liked the game better in its own window, you can \\nrevert back to the original approach where we set a specific screen size for \\nthe game.\\nNOTE  Make sure you can quit by pressing Q before running the game in fullscreen mode; \\nPygame offers no default way to quit a game while in fullscreen mode.\\nA Quick Recap\\nIn the next section, we’ll add the ability to shoot bullets, which involves add -\\ning a new file called bullet.py and making some modifications to some of the \\nfiles we’re already using. Right now, we have three files containing a num-\\nber of classes and methods.

The main loop of \\nthe game, a while loop, is also stored in this module. The while loop calls \\n_check_events(), ship.update(), and _update_screen().

We’ll write code that fires a bullet, \\nwhich is represented by a small rectangle, when the player presses the space -\\nbar. Bullets will then travel straight up the screen until they disappear off \\nthe top of the screen.\\nAdding the Bullet Settings\\nAt the end of the __init__() method, we’ll update settings.py to include the \\nvalues we’ll need for a new Bullet class:\\nsettings.py     def __init__(self):\\n        --snip--\\n        # Bullet settings\\n        self.bullet_speed = 2.0\\n        self.bullet_width = 3\\n        self.bullet_height = 15\\n        self.bullet_color = (60, 60, 60)\\nThese settings create dark gray bullets with a width of 3 pixels and a \\nheight of 15 pixels. The bullets will travel slightly faster than the ship.\\nCreating the Bullet Class\\nNow create a bullet.py file to store our Bullet class. Here’s the first part of \\nbullet.py:\\nbullet.py import pygame\\nfrom pygame.sprite import Sprite\\nclass Bullet(Sprite):\\n    \"\"\"A class to manage bullets fired from the ship.\"\"\"\\n    def __init__(self, ai_game):\\n        \"\"\"Create a bullet object at the ship\\'s current position.\"\"\"\\n        super().__init__()\\n        self.screen = ai_game.screen\\n        self.settings = ai_game.settings\\n        self.color = self.settings.bullet_color\\n        # Create a bullet rect at (0, 0) and then set correct position.\\n1         self.rect = pygame.Rect(0, 0, self.settings.bullet_width,\\n            self.settings.bullet_height)\\n2         self.rect.midtop = ai_game.ship.rect.midtop\\n        # Store the bullet\\'s position as a float.\\n3         self.y = float(self.rect.y)\\nThe Bullet class inherits from Sprite, which we import from the pygame \\n.sprite module.

We also set attributes for the screen \\nand settings objects, and for the bullet’s color.\\nNext we create the bullet’s rect attribute\\xa01. The bullet isn’t based on an \\nimage, so we have to build a rect from scratch using the pygame.Rect() class. \\nThis class requires the x- and y-coordinates of the top-left corner of the \\nrect, and the width and height of the rect. We initialize the rect at (0, 0), \\nbut we’ll move it to the correct location in the next line, because the bullet’s \\nposition depends on the ship’s position. We get the width and height of the \\nbullet from the values stored in self.settings.\\nWe set the bullet’s midtop attribute to match the ship’s midtop attribute\\xa02. \\nThis will make the bullet emerge from the top of the ship, making it look like \\nthe bullet is fired from the ship. We use a float for the bullet’s y-coordinate so \\nwe can make fine adjustments to the bullet’s speed\\xa03.\\nHere’s the second part of bullet.py, update() and draw_bullet():\\nbullet.py     def update(self):\\n        \"\"\"Move the bullet up the screen.\"\"\"\\n        # Update the exact position of the bullet.\\n1         self.y -= self.settings.bullet_speed\\n        # Update the rect position.\\n2         self.rect.y = self.y\\n    def draw_bullet(self):\\n        \"\"\"Draw the bullet to the screen.\"\"\"\\n3         pygame.draw.rect(self.screen, self.color, self.rect)\\nThe update() method manages the bullet’s position. When a bullet is \\nfired, it moves up the screen, which corresponds to a decreasing y-coordinate \\nvalue. To update the position, we subtract the amount stored in settings \\n.bullet_speed from self.y\\xa01. We then use the value of self.y to set the value  \\nof self.rect.y\\xa02.\\nThe bullet_speed setting allows us to increase the speed of the bullets \\nas the game progresses or as needed to refine the game’s behavior. Once a \\nbullet is fired, we never change the value of its x-coordinate, so it will travel \\nvertically in a straight line even if the ship moves.\\nWhen we want to draw a bullet, we call draw_bullet(). The draw.rect() \\nfunction fills the part of the screen defined by the bullet’s rect with the \\ncolor stored in self.color\\xa03.\\nStoring Bullets in a Group\\nNow that we have a Bullet class and the necessary settings defined, we can \\nwrite code to fire a bullet each time the player presses the spacebar. We’ll \\ncreate a group in AlienInvasion to store all the active bullets so we can man -\\nage the bullets that have already been fired. This group will be an instance \\nof the pygame.sprite.Group class, which behaves like a list with some extra \\nfunctionality that’s helpful when building games. We’ll use this group \\nto draw bullets to the screen on each pass through the main loop and to \\nupdate each bullet’s position.'),\n",

We use the copy() method to set \\nup the for loop\\xa01, which leaves us free to modify the original bullets group \\ninside the loop. We check each bullet to see whether it has disappeared off \\nthe top of the screen\\xa02. If it has, we remove it from bullets\\xa03. We insert a \\nprint() call to show how many bullets currently exist in the game and verify \\nthey’re being deleted when they reach the top of the screen\\xa04.\\nIf this code works correctly, we can watch the terminal output while fir -\\ning bullets and see that the number of bullets decreases to zero after each \\nseries of bullets has cleared the top of the screen. After you run the game \\nand verify that bullets are being deleted properly, remove the print() call. If \\nyou leave it in, the game will slow down significantly because it takes more \\ntime to write output to the terminal than it does to draw graphics to the \\ngame window.\\nLimiting the Number of Bullets\\nMany shooting games limit the number of bullets a player can have on the \\nscreen at one time; doing so encourages players to shoot accurately. We’ll \\ndo the same in Alien Invasion.\\nFirst, store the number of bullets allowed in settings.py:\\nsettings.py         # Bullet settings\\n        --snip--\\n        self.bullet_color = (60, 60, 60)\\n        self.bullets_allowed = 3'),\n",

We’ll create a new method called _update_bullets() \\nand add it just before _update_screen():\\nalien_invasion.py     def _update_bullets(self):\\n        \"\"\"Update position of bullets and get rid of old bullets.\"\"\"\\n        # Update bullet positions.\\n        self.bullets.update()\\n        # Get rid of bullets that have disappeared.\\n        for bullet in self.bullets.copy():\\n            if bullet.rect.bottom <= 0:\\n                 self.bullets.remove(bullet)\\nThe code for _update_bullets()  is cut and pasted from run_game(); all \\nwe’ve done here is clarify the comments.\\nThe while loop in run_game() looks simple again:\\nalien_invasion.py          while True:\\n            self._check_events()\\n            self.ship.update()\\n            self._update_bullets()\\n            self._update_screen()\\n            self.clock.tick(60)\\nNow our main loop contains only minimal code, so we can quickly read \\nthe method names and understand what’s happening in the game.

In this chapter, we’ll do \\nthe following:\\n•\\t Add a single alien to the top-left corner of the screen, with appropriate \\nspacing around it.\\n•\\t Fill the upper portion of the screen with as many aliens as we can fit \\nhorizontally. We’ll then create additional rows of aliens until we have a \\nfull fleet.\\n•\\t Make the fleet move sideways and down until the entire fleet is shot \\ndown, an alien hits the ship, or an alien reaches the ground. If the \\nentire fleet is shot down, we’ll create a new fleet. If an alien hits the \\nship or the ground, we’ll destroy the ship and create a new fleet.\\n•\\t Limit the number of ships the player can use, and end the game when \\nthe player has used up the allotted number of ships.\\nWe’ll refine this plan as we implement features, but this is specific \\nenough to start writing code.\\nYou should also review your existing code when you begin working on a \\nnew series of features in a project. Because each new phase typically makes \\na project more complex, it’s best to clean up any cluttered or inefficient \\ncode. We’ve been refactoring as we go, so there isn’t any code that we need \\nto refactor at this point.\\nCreating the First Alien\\nPlacing one alien on the screen is like placing a ship on the screen. Each \\nalien’s behavior is controlled by a class called Alien, which we’ll structure \\nlike the Ship class. We’ll continue using bitmap images for simplicity. You \\ncan find your own image for an alien or use the one shown in Figure\\xa013-1, \\nwhich is available in the book’s resources at https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e. \\nThis image has a gray background, which matches the screen’s background \\ncolor.

Because it’s part of our setup work, we’ll add the code for this  \\ninstance at the end of the __init__() method in AlienInvasion. Eventually, \\nwe’ll create an entire fleet of aliens, which will be quite a bit of work, so we’ll \\nmake a new helper method called _create_fleet().\\nThe order of methods in a class doesn’t matter, as long as there’s some \\nconsistency to how they’re placed.

Now we’ll add a call to update the position of each alien as well:\\nalien_invasion.py         while True:\\n            self._check_events()\\n            self.ship.update()\\n            self._update_bullets()\\n            self._update_aliens()\\n            self._update_screen()\\n            self.clock.tick(60)\\nWe’re about to write some code to manage the movement of the fleet, \\nso we create a new method called _update_aliens(). We update the aliens’ \\npositions after the bullets have been updated, because we’ll soon be check -\\ning to see whether any bullets hit any aliens.\\nWhere you place this method in the module is not critical. But to keep the \\ncode organized, I’ll place it just after _update_bullets() to match the order of \\nmethod calls in the while loop. Here’s the first version of _update_aliens():\\nalien_invasion.py     def _update_aliens(self):\\n        \"\"\"Update the positions of all aliens in the fleet.\"\"\"\\n        self.aliens.update()\\nWe use the update() method on the aliens group, which calls each \\nalien’s update() method. When you run Alien Invasion now, you should see \\nthe fleet move right and disappear off the side of the screen.\\nCreating Settings for Fleet Direction\\nNow we’ll create the settings that will make the fleet move down the screen \\nand to the left when it hits the right edge of the screen. Here’s how to \\nimplement this behavior:\\nsettings.py         # Alien settings\\n        self.alien_speed = 1.0\\n        self.fleet_drop_speed = 10\\n        # fleet_direction of 1 represents right; -1 represents left.\\n        self.fleet_direction = 1\\nThe setting fleet_drop_speed controls how quickly the fleet drops down \\nthe screen each time an alien reaches either edge. It’s helpful to separate \\nthis speed from the aliens’ horizontal speed so you can adjust the two \\nspeeds independently.\\nTo implement the setting fleet_direction, we could use a text value such \\nas \\'left\\' or \\'right\\', but we’d end up with if-elif statements testing for the \\nfleet direction. Instead, because we only have two directions to deal with, \\nlet’s use the values 1 and −1 and switch between them each time the fleet'),\n",

(Using numbers also makes sense because moving right \\ninvolves adding to each alien’s x-coordinate value, and moving left involves \\nsubtracting from each alien’s x-coordinate value.)\\nChecking Whether an Alien Has Hit the Edge\\nWe need a method to check whether an alien is at either edge, and we need \\nto modify update() to allow each alien to move in the appropriate direction. \\nThis code is part of the Alien class:\\nalien.py     def check_edges(self):\\n        \"\"\"Return True if alien is at edge of screen.\"\"\"\\n        screen_rect = self.screen.get_rect()\\n1         return (self.rect.right >= screen_rect.right) or (self.rect.left <= 0)\\n    def update(self):\\n        \"\"\"Move the alien right or left.\"\"\"\\n2         self.x += self.settings.alien_speed * self.settings.fleet_direction\\n        self.rect.x = self.x\\nWe can call the new method check_edges() on any alien to see whether \\nit’s at the left or right edge. The alien is at the right edge if the right attri-\\nbute of its rect is greater than or equal to the right attribute of the screen’s \\nrect. It’s at the left edge if its left value is less than or equal to 0\\xa0 1. Rather \\nthan put this conditional test in an if block, we put the test directly in the \\nreturn statement. This method will return True if the alien is at the right or \\nleft edge, and False if it is not at either edge.\\nWe modify the method update() to allow motion to the left or right  \\nby multiplying the alien’s speed by the value of fleet_direction\\xa02. If fleet \\n_direction is 1, the value of alien_speed will be added to the alien’s current \\nposition, moving the alien to the right; if fleet_direction is −1, the value will \\nbe subtracted from the alien’s position, moving the alien to the left.\\nDropping the Fleet and Changing Direction\\nWhen an alien reaches the edge, the entire fleet needs to drop down and \\nchange direction. Therefore, we need to add some code to AlienInvasion \\nbecause that’s where we’ll check whether any aliens are at the left or right \\nedge. We’ll make this happen by writing the methods _check_fleet_edges() \\nand _change_fleet_direction(), and then modifying _update_aliens(). I’ll put \\nthese new methods after _create_alien(), but again, the placement of these \\nmethods in the class isn’t critical.\\nalien \\n_invasion.py\\n    def _check_fleet_edges(self):\\n        \"\"\"Respond appropriately if any aliens have reached an edge.\"\"\"\\n1         for alien in self.aliens.sprites():\\n            if alien.check_edges():\\n2                 self._change_fleet_direction()\\n                break\\n    def _change_fleet_direction(self):'),\n",

In \\ngame programming, collisions happen when game elements overlap. To make \\nthe bullets shoot down aliens, we’ll use the function sprite.groupcollide() to \\nlook for collisions between members of two groups.'),\n",

To do this, we’ll look for collisions imme -\\ndiately after updating the position of all the bullets.\\nThe sprite.groupcollide() function compares the rects of each element in \\none group with the rects of each element in another group. In this case, it com-\\npares each bullet’s rect with each alien’s rect and returns a dictionary contain-\\ning the bullets and aliens that have collided. Each key in the dictionary will be \\na bullet, and the corresponding value will be the alien that was hit. (We’ll also \\nuse this dictionary when we implement a scoring system in Chapter\\xa014.)\\nAdd the following code to the end of _update_bullets() to check for colli-\\nsions between bullets and aliens:\\nalien_invasion.py     def _update_bullets(self):\\n        \"\"\"Update position of bullets and get rid of old bullets.\"\"\"\\n        --snip--\\n        # Check for any bullets that have hit aliens.\\n        #   If so, get rid of the bullet and the alien.\\n        collisions = pygame.sprite.groupcollide(\\n                self.bullets, self.aliens, True, True)\\nThe new code we added compares the positions of all the bullets in \\nself.bullets and all the aliens in self.aliens, and identifies any that overlap. \\nWhenever the rects of a bullet and alien overlap, groupcollide() adds a key-\\nvalue pair to the dictionary it returns. The two True arguments tell Pygame \\nto delete the bullets and aliens that have collided. (To make a high-powered \\nbullet that can travel to the top of the screen, destroying every alien in its \\npath, you could set the first Boolean argument to False and keep the second \\nBoolean argument set to True. The aliens hit would disappear, but all bullets \\nwould stay active until they disappeared off the top of the screen.)\\nWhen you run Alien Invasion now, aliens you hit should disappear. \\nFigure\\xa013-5 shows a fleet that has been partially shot down.\\nFigure\\xa013-5: We can shoot aliens!'),\n",

For \\nexample, it’s a lot of work to shoot down every alien on the screen multiple \\ntimes to test whether your code responds to an empty fleet correctly.\\nTo test particular features, you can change certain game settings to \\nfocus on a particular area. For example, you might shrink the screen so \\nthere are fewer aliens to shoot down or increase the bullet speed and give \\nyourself lots of bullets at once.\\nMy favorite change for testing Alien Invasion is to use really wide bul -\\nlets that remain active even after they’ve hit an alien (see Figure\\xa013-6). Try \\nsetting bullet_width to 300, or even 3,000, to see how quickly you can shoot \\ndown the fleet!\\nFigure\\xa013-6: Extra-powerful bullets make some aspects of the game  \\neasier to test.\\nChanges like these will help you test the game more efficiently and pos -\\nsibly spark ideas for giving players bonus powers. Just remember to restore \\nthe settings to normal when you’re finished testing a feature.\\nRepopulating the Fleet\\nOne key feature of Alien Invasion is that the aliens are relentless: every time \\nthe fleet is destroyed, a new fleet should appear.\\nTo make a new fleet of aliens appear after a fleet has been destroyed, \\nwe first check whether the aliens group is empty. If it is, we make a call \\nto _create_fleet(). We’ll perform this check at the end of _update_bullets(), \\nbecause that’s where individual aliens are destroyed.\\nalien \\n_invasion.py\\n    def _update_bullets(self):\\n        --snip--\\n1         if not self.aliens:'),\n",

An empty group evaluates \\nto False, so this is a simple way to check whether the group is empty. If it is, we \\nget rid of any existing bullets by using the empty() method, which removes  \\nall the remaining sprites from a group\\xa02. We also call _create_fleet(), which \\nfills the screen with aliens again.\\nNow a new fleet appears as soon as you destroy the current fleet.\\nSpeeding Up the Bullets\\nIf you’ve tried firing at the aliens in the game’s current state, you might find \\nthat the bullets aren’t traveling at the best speed for gameplay. They might \\nbe a little too slow or a little too fast. At this point, you can modify the set -\\ntings to make the gameplay more interesting. Keep in mind that the game \\nis going to get progressively faster, so don’t make the game too fast at the \\nbeginning.\\nWe modify the speed of the bullets by adjusting the value of bullet_speed \\nin settings.py. On my system, I’ll adjust the value of bullet_speed to 2.5, so the \\nbullets travel a little faster:\\nsettings.py         # Bullet settings\\n        self.bullet_speed = 2.5\\n        self.bullet_width = 3\\n        --snip--\\nThe best value for this setting depends on your experience of the game, \\nso find a value that works for you. You can adjust other settings as well.\\nRefactoring _update_bullets()\\nLet’s refactor _update_bullets()  so it’s not doing so many different tasks. \\nWe’ll move the code for dealing with bullet-alien collisions to a separate \\nmethod:\\nalien_invasion.py    def _update_bullets(self):\\n        --snip--\\n        # Get rid of bullets that have disappeared.\\n        for bullet in self.bullets.copy():\\n            if bullet.rect.bottom <= 0:\\n                 self.bullets.remove(bullet)\\n        self._check_bullet_alien_collisions()\\n    def _check_bullet_alien_collisions(self):\\n        \"\"\"Respond to bullet-alien collisions.\"\"\"\\n        # Remove any bullets and aliens that have collided.\\n        collisions = pygame.sprite.groupcollide(\\n                self.bullets, self.aliens, True, True)'),\n",

Doing so keeps _update_bullets() from grow-\\ning too long and simplifies further development.\\nTRY IT YOURSELF\\n13-5. Sideways Shooter Part\\xa02: We’ve come a long way since Exercise 12-6, \\nSideways Shooter. For this exercise, try to develop Sideways Shooter to the \\nsame point we’ve brought Alien Invasion to. Add a fleet of aliens, and make \\nthem move sideways toward the ship. Or, write code that places aliens at ran -\\ndom positions along the right side of the screen and then sends them toward \\nthe ship. Also, write code that makes the aliens disappear when they’re hit.\\nEnding the Game\\nWhat’s the fun and challenge in playing a game you can’t lose? If the player \\ndoesn’t shoot down the fleet quickly enough, we’ll have the aliens destroy \\nthe ship when they make contact. At the same time, we’ll limit the number \\nof ships a player can use, and we’ll destroy the ship when an alien reaches \\nthe bottom of the screen. The game will end when the player has used up \\nall their ships.\\nDetecting Alien-Ship Collisions\\nWe’ll start by checking for collisions between aliens and the ship so we can \\nrespond appropriately when an alien hits it. We’ll check for alien-ship colli -\\nsions immediately after updating the position of each alien in AlienInvasion:\\nalien \\n_invasion.py\\n    def _update_aliens(self):\\n        --snip--\\n        self.aliens.update()\\n        # Look for alien-ship collisions.\\n1         if pygame.sprite.spritecollideany(self.ship, self.aliens):\\n2             print(\"Ship hit!!!\")\\nThe spritecollideany() function takes two arguments: a sprite and a \\ngroup. The function looks for any member of the group that has collided \\nwith the sprite and stops looping through the group as soon as it finds one \\nmember that has collided with the sprite. Here, it loops through the group \\naliens and returns the first alien it finds that has collided with ship.'),\n",

If it finds an alien that has collided with the ship, it returns \\nthat alien and the if block executes: it prints Ship hit!!!\\xa02. When an alien \\nhits the ship, we’ll need to do a number of tasks: delete all remaining aliens \\nand bullets, recenter the ship, and create a new fleet. Before we write code \\nto do all this, we want to know that our approach to detecting alien-ship col-\\nlisions works correctly. Writing a print() call is a simple way to ensure we’re \\ndetecting these collisions properly.\\nNow when you run Alien Invasion, the message Ship hit!!! should appear \\nin the terminal whenever an alien runs into the ship. When you’re testing \\nthis feature, set fleet_drop_speed to a higher value, such as 50 or 100, so the \\naliens reach your ship faster.\\nResponding to Alien-Ship Collisions\\nNow we need to figure out exactly what will happen when an alien collides \\nwith the ship. Instead of destroying the ship instance and creating a new \\none, we’ll count how many times the ship has been hit by tracking statistics \\nfor the game. Tracking statistics will also be useful for scoring.\\nLet’s write a new class, GameStats, to track game statistics, and let’s save it \\nas game_stats.py:\\ngame_stats.py class GameStats:\\n    \"\"\"Track statistics for Alien Invasion.\"\"\"\\n    def __init__(self, ai_game):\\n        \"\"\"Initialize statistics.\"\"\"\\n        self.settings = ai_game.settings\\n1         self.reset_stats()\\n    def reset_stats(self):\\n        \"\"\"Initialize statistics that can change during the game.\"\"\"\\n        self.ships_left = self.settings.ship_limit\\nWe’ll make one GameStats instance for the entire time Alien Invasion is \\nrunning, but we’ll need to reset some statistics each time the player starts a \\nnew game. To do this, we’ll initialize most of the statistics in the reset_stats() \\nmethod, instead of directly in __init__(). We’ll call this method from __init__() \\nso the statistics are set properly when the GameStats instance is first created\\xa01. \\nBut we’ll also be able to call reset_stats() anytime the player starts a new game. \\nRight now we have only one statistic, ships_left, the value of which will change \\nthroughout the game.\\nThe number of ships the player starts with should be stored in settings.py \\nas ship_limit:\\nsettings.py         # Ship settings\\n        self.ship_speed = 1.5\\n        self.ship_limit = 3'),\n",

We’ll also pause the game for a moment \\nso the player can notice the collision and regroup before a new fleet appears.\\nLet’s put most of this code in a new method called _ship_hit(). We’ll call \\nthis method from _update_aliens() when an alien hits the ship:\\nalien \\n_invasion.py\\n    def _ship_hit(self):\\n        \"\"\"Respond to the ship being hit by an alien.\"\"\"\\n        # Decrement ships_left.\\n1         self.stats.ships_left -= 1\\n        # Get rid of any remaining bullets and aliens.\\n2         self.bullets.empty()\\n        self.aliens.empty()\\n        # Create a new fleet and center the ship.\\n3         self._create_fleet()\\n        self.ship.center_ship()'),\n",

If the player has \\nno ships left, we set game_active to False.\\nIdentifying When Parts of the Game Should Run\\nWe need to identify the parts of the game that should always run and the \\nparts that should run only when the game is active:\\nalien_invasion.py     def run_game(self):\\n        \"\"\"Start the main loop for the game.\"\"\"\\n        while True:\\n            self._check_events()\\n            if self.game_active:\\n                self.ship.update()\\n                self._update_bullets()\\n                self._update_aliens()\\n            self._update_screen()\\n            self.clock.tick(60)\\nIn the main loop, we always need to call _check_events(), even if the \\ngame is inactive. For example, we still need to know if the user presses Q to \\nquit the game or clicks the button to close the window. We also continue \\nupdating the screen so we can make changes to the screen while waiting to \\nsee whether the player chooses to start a new game. The rest of the function \\ncalls need to happen only when the game is active, because when the game \\nis inactive, we don’t need to update the positions of game elements.\\nNow when you play Alien Invasion, the game should freeze when you’ve \\nused up all your ships.\\nTRY IT YOURSELF\\n13-6.

Let’s \\nstart the game in an inactive state and then prompt the player to click a Play \\nbutton to begin. To do this, modify the __init__() method of AlienInvasion:\\nalien_invasion.py     def __init__(self):\\n        \"\"\"Initialize the game, and create game resources.\"\"\"\\n        pygame.init()\\n        --snip--\\n        # Start Alien Invasion in an inactive state.\\n        self.game_active = False\\nNow the game should start in an inactive state, with no way for the \\nplayer to start it until we make a Play button.\\nCreating a Button Class\\nBecause Pygame doesn’t have a built-in method for making buttons, we’ll \\nwrite a Button class to create a filled rectangle with a label. You can use this \\ncode to make any button in a game. Here’s the first part of the Button class; \\nsave it as button.py:\\nbutton.py import pygame.font\\nclass Button:\\n    \"\"\"A class to build buttons for the game.\"\"\"\\n1     def __init__(self, ai_game, msg):\\n        \"\"\"Initialize button attributes.\"\"\"\\n        self.screen = ai_game.screen\\n        self.screen_rect = self.screen.get_rect()\\n        # Set the dimensions and properties of the button.\\n2         self.width, self.height = 200, 50\\n        self.button_color = (0, 135, 0)\\n        self.text_color = (255, 255, 255)\\n3         self.font = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 48)\\n        # Build the button\\'s rect object and center it.\\n4         self.rect = pygame.Rect(0, 0, self.width, self.height)\\n        self.rect.center = self.screen_rect.center\\n        # The button message needs to be prepped only once.\\n5         self._prep_msg(msg)\\nFirst, we import the pygame.font module, which lets Pygame render text \\nto the screen. The __init__() method takes the parameters self, the ai_game \\nobject, and msg, which contains the button’s text\\xa01. We set the button \\ndimensions\\xa02, set button_color to color the button’s rect object dark green, \\nand set text_color to render the text in white.'),\n",

The None argu-\\nment tells Pygame to use the default font, and 48 specifies the size of the \\ntext. To center the button on the screen, we create a rect for the button\\xa04 \\nand set its center attribute to match that of the screen.\\nPygame works with text by rendering the string you want to display as \\nan image. Finally, we call _prep_msg() to handle this rendering\\xa05.\\nHere’s the code for _prep_msg():\\nbutton.py     def _prep_msg(self, msg):\\n        \"\"\"Turn msg into a rendered image and center text on the button.\"\"\"\\n1         self.msg_image = self.font.render(msg, True, self.text_color,\\n                self.button_color)\\n2         self.msg_image_rect = self.msg_image.get_rect()\\n        self.msg_image_rect.center = self.rect.center\\nThe _prep_msg() method needs a self parameter and the text to be ren-\\ndered as an image ( msg). The call to font.render() turns the text stored in \\nmsg into an image, which we then store in self.msg_image\\xa01. The font.render() \\nmethod also takes a Boolean value to turn antialiasing on or off (antialiasing \\nmakes the edges of the text smoother). The remaining arguments are the \\nspecified font color and background color. We set antialiasing to True and set \\nthe text background to the same color as the button. (If you don’t include \\na background color, Pygame will try to render the font with a transparent \\nbackground.)\\nWe center the text image on the button by creating a rect from the \\nimage and setting its center attribute to match that of the button\\xa0 2.\\nFinally, we create a draw_button() method that we can call to display the \\nbutton onscreen:\\nbutton.py     def draw_button(self):\\n        \"\"\"Draw blank button and then draw message.\"\"\"\\n        self.screen.fill(self.button_color, self.rect)\\n        self.screen.blit(self.msg_image, self.msg_image_rect)\\nWe call screen.fill() to draw the rectangular portion of the button. Then \\nwe call screen.blit() to draw the text image to the screen, passing it an image \\nand the rect object associated with the image. This completes the Button class.\\nDrawing the Button to the Screen\\nWe’ll use the Button class to create a Play button in AlienInvasion.

Here’s \\nthe first part of the class; save it as scoreboard.py:\\nscoreboard.py import pygame.font\\nclass Scoreboard:\\n    \"\"\"A class to report scoring information.\"\"\"\\n1     def __init__(self, ai_game):\\n        \"\"\"Initialize scorekeeping attributes.\"\"\"\\n        self.screen = ai_game.screen\\n        self.screen_rect = self.screen.get_rect()\\n        self.settings = ai_game.settings\\n        self.stats = ai_game.stats\\n        # Font settings for scoring information.\\n2         self.text_color = (30, 30, 30)\\n3         self.font = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 48)'),\n",

Next, we give __init__() the ai_game parameter so it can \\naccess the settings, screen, and stats objects, which it will need to report the \\nvalues we’re tracking\\xa01. Then we set a text color\\xa02 and instantiate a font \\nobject\\xa03.\\nTo turn the text to be displayed into an image, we call prep_score()\\xa04, \\nwhich we define here:\\nscoreboard.py     def prep_score(self):\\n        \"\"\"Turn the score into a rendered image.\"\"\"\\n1         score_str = str(self.stats.score)\\n2         self.score_image = self.font.render(score_str, True,\\n                self.text_color, self.settings.bg_color)\\n        # Display the score at the top right of the screen.\\n3         self.score_rect = self.score_image.get_rect()\\n4         self.score_rect.right = self.screen_rect.right - 20\\n5         self.score_rect.top = 20\\nIn prep_score(), we turn the numerical value stats.score into a string\\xa01 \\nand then pass this string to render(), which creates the image\\xa02. To display \\nthe score clearly onscreen, we pass the screen’s background color and the \\ntext color to render().\\nWe’ll position the score in the upper-right corner of the screen and \\nhave it expand to the left as the score increases and the width of the num -\\nber grows. To make sure the score always lines up with the right side of  \\nthe screen, we create a rect called score_rect\\xa03 and set its right edge 20 pixels \\nfrom the right edge of the screen\\xa04. We then place the top edge 20 pixels \\ndown from the top of the screen\\xa05.\\nThen we create a show_score() method to display the rendered score \\nimage:\\nscoreboard.py     def show_score(self):\\n        \"\"\"Draw score to the screen.\"\"\"\\n        self.screen.blit(self.score_image, self.score_rect)\\nThis method draws the score image onscreen at the location score_rect \\nspecifies.\\nMaking a Scoreboard\\nTo display the score, we’ll create a Scoreboard instance in AlienInvasion.

We then call prep_score() to create a new image for the \\nupdated score.\\nNow when you play Alien Invasion, you should be able to rack up points!\\nResetting the Score\\nRight now, we’re only prepping a new score after an alien has been hit, \\nwhich works for most of the game. But when we start a new game, we’ll still \\nsee our score from the old game until the first alien is hit.\\nWe can fix this by prepping the score when starting a new game:\\nalien_invasion.py     def _check_play_button(self, mouse_pos):\\n        --snip--\\n        if button_clicked and not self.game_active:\\n            --snip--\\n            # Reset the game statistics.\\n            self.stats.reset_stats()\\n            self.sb.prep_score()\\n            --snip--'),\n",

This preps the scoreboard with a score of 0.\\nMaking Sure to Score All Hits\\nAs currently written, our code could miss scoring for some aliens. For example, \\nif two bullets collide with aliens during the same pass through the loop or \\nif we make an extra-wide bullet to hit multiple aliens, the player will only \\nreceive points for hitting one of the aliens. To fix this, let’s refine the way \\nthat bullet-alien collisions are detected.\\nIn _check_bullet_alien_collisions(), any bullet that collides with an alien \\nbecomes a key in the collisions dictionary. The value associated with each \\nbullet is a list of aliens it has collided with. We loop through the values in \\nthe collisions dictionary to make sure we award points for each alien hit:\\nalien_invasion.py     def _check_bullet_alien_collisions(self):\\n        --snip--\\n        if collisions:\\n            for aliens in collisions.values():\\n                self.stats.score += self.settings.alien_points * len(aliens)\\n            self.sb.prep_score()\\n    --snip--\\nIf the collisions dictionary has been defined, we loop through all values \\nin the dictionary. Remember that each value is a list of aliens hit by a single \\nbullet. We multiply the value of each alien by the number of aliens in each list \\nand add this amount to the current score. To test this, change the width of \\na bullet to 300 pixels and verify that you receive points for each alien you hit \\nwith your extra-wide bullets; then return the bullet width to its normal value.\\nIncreasing Point Values\\nBecause the game gets more difficult each time a player reaches a new level, \\naliens in later levels should be worth more points. To implement this func-\\ntionality, we’ll add code to increase the point value when the game’s speed \\nincreases:\\nsettings.py class Settings:\\n    \"\"\"A class to store all settings for Alien Invasion.\"\"\"\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        --snip--\\n        # How quickly the game speeds up\\n        self.speedup_scale = 1.1\\n        # How quickly the alien point values increase\\n1         self.score_scale = 1.5\\n        self.initialize_dynamic_settings()\\n    def initialize_dynamic_settings(self):\\n        --snip--'),\n",

Now when we increase the game’s \\nspeed, we also increase the point value of each hit\\xa02. We use the int() func-\\ntion to increase the point value by whole integers.\\nTo see the value of each alien, add a print() call to the increase_speed() \\nmethod in Settings:\\nsettings.py     def increase_speed(self):\\n        --snip--\\n        self.alien_points = int(self.alien_points * self.score_scale)\\n        print(self.alien_points)\\nThe new point value should appear in the terminal every time you \\nreach a new level.\\nNOTE  Be sure to remove the print() call after verifying that the point value is increasing, or \\nit might affect your game’s performance and distract the player.\\nRounding the Score\\nMost arcade-style shooting games report scores as multiples of 10, so let’s fol-\\nlow that lead with our scores. Also, let’s format the score to include comma \\nseparators in large numbers. We’ll make this change in Scoreboard:\\nscoreboard.py     def prep_score(self):\\n        \"\"\"Turn the score into a rendered image.\"\"\"\\n        rounded_score = round(self.stats.score, -1)\\n        score_str = f\"{rounded_score:,}\"\\n        self.score_image = self.font.render(score_str, True,\\n                self.text_color, self.settings.bg_color)\\n        --snip--\\nThe round() function normally rounds a float to a set number of deci -\\nmal places given as the second argument. However, when you pass a nega -\\ntive number as the second argument, round() will round the value to the \\nnearest 10, 100, 1,000, and so on. This code tells Python to round the value \\nof stats.score to the nearest 10 and assign it to rounded_score.\\nWe then use a format specifier in the f-string for the score. A format \\nspecifier  is a special sequence of characters that modifies the way a vari -\\nable’s value is presented. In this case the sequence :, tells Python to insert'),\n",

Data scientists have writ -\\nten an impressive array of visualization and analysis tools in Python, many of \\nwhich are available to you as well. One of the most popular tools is Matplotlib, \\na mathematical plotting library. In this chapter, we’ll use Matplotlib to make \\nsimple plots, such as line graphs and scatter plots. Then we’ll create a more \\ninteresting dataset based on the concept of a random walk—a visualization \\ngenerated from a series of random decisions.\\nWe’ll also use a package called Plotly, which creates visualizations that \\nwork well on digital devices, to analyze the results of rolling dice. Plotly gener-\\nates visualizations that automatically resize to fit a variety of display devices. \\nThese visualizations can also include a number of interactive features, such as \\nemphasizing particular aspects of the dataset when users hover over different \\nparts of the visualization. Learning to use Matplotlib and Plotly will help you \\nget started visualizing the kinds of data you’re most interested in.\\nInstalling Matplotlib\\nTo use Matplotlib for your initial set of visualizations, you’ll need to install \\nit using pip, just like we did with pytest in Chapter\\xa011 (see “Installing pytest \\nwith pip” on page 210).\\nTo install Matplotlib, enter the following command at a terminal prompt:\\n$ python -m pip install --user matplotlib\\nIf you use a command other than python to run programs or start a ter -\\nminal session, such as python3, your command will look like this:\\n$ python3 -m pip install --user matplotlib\\nTo see the kinds of visualizations you can make with Matplotlib, visit the \\nMatplotlib home page at https://matplotlib.org and click Plot types. When you \\nclick a visualization in the gallery, you’ll see the code used to generate the plot.\\nPlotting a Simple Line Graph\\nLet’s plot a simple line graph using Matplotlib and then customize it to \\ncreate a more informative data visualization. We’ll use the square number \\nsequence 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25 as the data for the graph.\\nTo make a simple line graph, specify the numbers you want to work \\nwith and let Matplotlib do the rest:\\nmpl_squares.py import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nsquares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]'),\n",

A random walk  is a path that’s determined by a series of simple deci -\\nsions, each of which is left entirely to chance. You might imagine a random \\nwalk as the path a confused ant would take if it took every step in a ran -\\ndom direction.\\nRandom walks have practical applications in nature, physics, biology, \\nchemistry, and economics. For example, a pollen grain floating on a drop \\nof water moves across the surface of the water because it’s constantly pushed \\naround by water molecules. Molecular motion in a water drop is random, \\nso the path a pollen grain traces on the surface is a random walk. The code \\nwe’ll write next models many real-world situations.\\nCreating the RandomWalk Class\\nTo create a random walk, we’ll create a RandomWalk class, which will make ran-\\ndom decisions about which direction the walk should take. The class needs \\nthree attributes: one variable to track the number of points in the walk, and \\ntwo lists to store the x- and y-coordinates of each point in the walk.\\nWe’ll only need two methods for the RandomWalk class: the __init__() \\nmethod and fill_walk(), which will calculate the points in the walk. Let’s \\nstart with the __init__() method:\\nrandom \\n_walk.py\\n1 from random import choice\\nclass RandomWalk:\\n    \"\"\"A class to generate random walks.\"\"\"\\n2     def __init__(self, num_points=5000):\\n        \"\"\"Initialize attributes of a walk.\"\"\"\\n        self.num_points = num_points\\n        # All walks start at (0, 0).\\n3         self.x_values = [0]\\n        self.y_values = [0]\\nTo make random decisions, we’ll store possible moves in a list and use \\nthe choice() function (from the random module) to decide which move to \\nmake each time a step is taken\\xa01. We set the default number of points in \\na walk to 5000, which is large enough to generate some interesting patterns \\nbut small enough to generate walks quickly\\xa0 2. Then we make two lists to \\nhold the x- and y-values, and we start each walk at the point (0, 0)\\xa0 3.\\nChoosing Directions\\nWe’ll use the fill_walk() method to determine the full sequence of points \\nin the walk.

The inclusion of a 0 allows for the \\npossibility of steps that have movement along only one axis.\\nWe determine the length of each step in the x- and y-directions by mul-\\ntiplying the direction of movement by the distance chosen\\xa0 3\\xa04. A positive \\nresult for x_step means move to the right, a negative result means move \\nto the left, and 0 means move vertically. A positive result for y_step means \\nmove up, negative means move down, and 0 means move horizontally. If the \\nvalues of both x_step and y_step are 0, the walk doesn’t go anywhere; when \\nthis happens, we continue the loop\\xa05.\\nTo get the next x-value for the walk, we add the value in x_step to the \\nlast value stored in x_values\\xa06 and do the same for the y-values. When we \\nhave the new point’s coordinates, we append them to x_values and y_values.\\nPlotting the Random Walk\\nHere’s the code to plot all the points in the walk:\\nrw_visual.py import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nfrom random_walk import RandomWalk\\n# Make a random walk.'),\n",

To do so, we \\nidentify the characteristics we want to emphasize, such as where the walk \\nbegan, where it ended, and the path taken. Next, we identify the character -\\nistics to deemphasize, such as tick marks and labels. The result should be \\na simple visual representation that clearly communicates the path taken in \\neach random walk.\\nColoring the Points\\nWe’ll use a colormap to show the order of the points in the walk, and \\nremove the black outline from each dot so the color of the dots will be \\nclearer. To color the points according to their position in the walk, we \\npass the c argument a list containing the position of each point.

These visualizations are also interactive; when the user hov -\\ners over certain elements on the screen, information about those elements \\nis highlighted. We’ll build our initial visualization in just a couple lines of \\ncode using Plotly Express, a subset of Plotly that focuses on generating plots \\nwith as little code as possible. Once we know our plot is correct, we’ll cus -\\ntomize the output just as we did with Matplotlib.\\nIn this project, we’ll analyze the results of rolling dice. When you roll \\none regular, six-sided die, you have an equal chance of rolling any of the \\nnumbers from 1 through 6. However, when you use two dice, you’re more \\nlikely to roll certain numbers than others. We’ll try to determine which \\nnumbers are most likely to occur by generating a dataset that represents \\nrolling dice. Then we’ll plot the results of a large number of rolls to deter -\\nmine which results are more likely than others.\\nThis work helps model games involving dice, but the core ideas also apply \\nto games that involve chance of any kind, such as card games. It also relates to \\nmany real-world situations where randomness plays a significant factor.'),\n",

If an argument is included, that value will set \\nthe number of sides on the die. (Dice are named for their number of sides: \\na six-sided die is a D6, an eight-sided die is a D8, and so on.)\\nThe roll() method uses the randint() function to return a random number \\nbetween 1 and the number of sides\\xa02. This function can return the starting \\nvalue (1), the ending value (num_sides), or any integer between the two.\\nRolling the Die\\nBefore creating a visualization based on the Die class, let’s roll a D6, print \\nthe results, and check that the results look reasonable:\\ndie_visual.py from die import Die\\n# Create a D6.\\n1 die = Die()'),\n",

Being able to access and visualize \\nonline data is essential to working with a wide variety of real-world datasets.\\nThe CSV File Format\\nOne simple way to store data in a text file is to write the data as a series of \\nvalues separated by commas, called comma-separated values. The resulting files \\nare CSV files. For example, here’s a chunk of weather data in CSV format:\\n\"USW00025333\",\"SITKA AIRPORT, AK US\",\"2021-01-01\",,\"44\",\"40\"\\nThis is an excerpt of weather data from January 1, 2021, in Sitka, Alaska. \\nIt includes the day’s high and low temperatures, as well as a number of other \\nmeasurements from that day. CSV files can be tedious for humans to read, \\nbut programs can process and extract information from them quickly and \\naccurately.\\nWe’ll begin with a small set of CSV-formatted weather data recorded \\nin Sitka; it is available in this book’s resources at https://ehmatthes.github.io/\\npcc_3e. Make a folder called weather_data inside the folder where you’re sav-\\ning this chapter’s programs. Copy the file sitka_weather_07-2021_simple.csv \\ninto this new folder. (After you download this book’s resources, you’ll have \\nall the files you need for this project.)\\nNOTE  The weather data in this project was originally downloaded from https:/ /ncdc \\n.noaa.gov/cdo-web.\\nParsing the CSV File Headers\\nPython’s csv module in the standard library parses the lines in a CSV file \\nand allows us to quickly extract the values we’re interested in. Let’s start by \\nexamining the first line of the file, which contains a series of headers for \\nthe data. These headers tell us what kind of information the data holds:\\nsitka_highs.py from pathlib import Path\\nimport csv\\n1 path = Path(\\'weather_data/sitka_weather_07-2021_simple.csv\\')\\nlines = path.read_text().splitlines()\\n2 reader = csv.reader(lines)\\n3 header_row = next(reader)\\nprint(header_row)\\nWe first import Path and the csv module. We then build a Path object \\nthat looks in the weather_data folder, and points to the specific weather data \\nfile we want to work with\\xa01. We read the file and chain the splitlines() \\nmethod to get a list of all lines in the file, which we assign to lines.'),\n",

This is an object that can be used  \\nto parse each line in the file. To make a reader object, call the function  \\ncsv.reader() and pass it the list of lines from the CSV file.\\nWhen given a reader object, the next() function returns the next line \\nin the file, starting from the beginning of the file. Here we call next() only \\nonce, so we get the first line of the file, which contains the file headers\\xa0 3. \\nWe assign the data that’s returned to header_row. As you can see, header_row \\ncontains meaningful, weather-related headers that tell us what information \\neach line of data holds:\\n['STATION', 'NAME', 'DATE', 'TAVG', 'TMAX', 'TMIN']\\nThe reader object processes the first line of comma-separated values in \\nthe file and stores each value as an item in a list. The header STATION repre-\\nsents the code for the weather station that recorded this data. The position \\nof this header tells us that the first value in each line will be the weather \\nstation code. The NAME header indicates that the second value in each line \\nis the name of the weather station that made the recording. The rest of \\nthe headers specify what kinds of information were recorded in each read -\\ning. The data we’re most interested in for now are the date (DATE), the high \\ntemperature (TMAX), and the low temperature (TMIN). This is a simple dataset \\nthat contains only temperature-related data. When you download your own \\nweather data, you can choose to include a number of other measurements \\nrelating to wind speed, wind direction, and precipitation data.\\nPrinting the Headers and Their Positions\\nTo make it easier to understand the file header data, let’s print each header \\nand its position in the list:\\nsitka_highs.py --snip--\\nreader = csv.reader(lines)\\nheader_row = next(reader)\\nfor index, column_header in enumerate(header_row):\\n    print(index, column_header)\\nThe enumerate() function returns both the index of each item and the \\nvalue of each item as you loop through a list. (Note that we’ve removed the \\nline print(header_row) in favor of this more detailed version.)\\nHere’s the output showing the index of each header:\\n0 STATION\\n1 NAME\\n2 DATE\\n3 TAVG\\n4 TMAX\\n5 TMIN\"),\n",

To explore this data, we’ll process each row of data in sitka \\n_weather_07-2021_simple.csv and extract the values with the indexes 2 and 4.\\nExtracting and Reading Data\\nNow that we know which columns of data we need, let’s read in some of that \\ndata. First, we’ll read in the high temperature for each day:\\nsitka_highs.py --snip--\\nreader = csv.reader(lines)\\nheader_row = next(reader)\\n# Extract high temperatures.\\n1 highs = []\\n2 for row in reader:\\n3     high = int(row[4])\\n    highs.append(high)\\nprint(highs)\\nWe make an empty list called highs\\xa01 and then loop through the \\nremaining rows in the file\\xa02. The reader object continues from where it left \\noff in the CSV file and automatically returns each line following its current \\nposition. Because we’ve already read the header row, the loop will begin \\nat the second line where the actual data begins. On each pass through the \\nloop we pull the data from index 4, corresponding to the header TMAX, and \\nassign it to the variable high\\xa03. We use the int() function to convert the \\ndata, which is stored as a string, to a numerical format so we can use it. We \\nthen append this value to highs.\\nThe following listing shows the data now stored in highs:\\n[61, 60, 66, 60, 65, 59, 58, 58, 57, 60, 60, 60, 57, 58, 60, 61, 63, 63, 70,\\n 64, 59, 63, 61, 58, 59, 64, 62, 70, 70, 73, 66]\\nWe’ve extracted the high temperature for each date and stored each \\nvalue in a list. Now let’s create a visualization of this data.\\nPlotting Data in a Temperature Chart\\nTo visualize the temperature data we have, we’ll first create a simple plot of \\nthe daily highs using Matplotlib, as shown here:\\nsitka_highs.py from pathlib import Path\\nimport csv\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\npath = Path('weather_data/sitka_weather_07-2021_simple.csv')\\nlines = path.read_text().splitlines()\\n    --snip--\"),\n",

Most apps that use external \\ndata sources, such as apps that integrate with social media sites, rely on \\nAPI calls.\\nGit and GitHub\\nWe’ll base our visualization on information from GitHub ( https://g ithub.com), \\na site that allows programmers to collaborate on coding projects. We’ll use \\nGitHub’s API to request information about Python projects on the site, and \\nthen generate an interactive visualization of the relative popularity of these \\nprojects using Plotly.\\nGitHub takes its name from Git, a distributed version control system. \\nGit helps people manage their work on a project in a way that prevents \\nchanges made by one person from interfering with changes other people \\nare making. When you implement a new feature in a project, Git tracks the \\nchanges you make to each file. When your new code works, you commit  \\nthe changes you’ve made, and Git records the new state of your project. If \\nyou make a mistake and want to revert your changes, you can easily return \\nto any previously working state. (To learn more about version control using \\nGit, see Appendix D.) Projects on GitHub are stored in repositories, which \\ncontain everything associated with the project: its code, information on its \\ncollaborators, any issues or bug reports, and so on.\\nWhen users on GitHub like a project, they can “star” it to show their \\nsupport and keep track of projects they might want to use. In this chapter, \\nwe’ll write a program to automatically download information about the \\nmost-starred Python projects on GitHub, and then we’ll create an informa -\\ntive visualization of these projects.\\nRequesting Data Using an API Call\\nGitHub’s API lets you request a wide range of information through API \\ncalls. To see what an API call looks like, enter the following into your brows -\\ner’s address bar and press ENTER:\\nhttps://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=language:python+sort:stars\\nThis call returns the number of Python projects currently hosted on \\nGitHub, as well as information about the most popular Python repositories. \\nLet’s examine the call. The first part, https://api.github.com/, directs the \\nrequest to the part of GitHub that responds to API calls. The next part, \\nsearch/repositories, tells the API to conduct a search through all the reposi -\\ntories on GitHub.\\nThe question mark after repositories signals that we’re about to pass \\nan argument. The q stands for query , and the equal sign ( =) lets us begin \\nspecifying a query ( q=). By using language:python, we indicate that we want \\ninformation only on repositories that have Python as the primary language. \\nThe final part, +sort:stars, sorts the projects by the number of stars they’ve \\nbeen given.'),\n",

A good place to start is with the article \\n“Plotly Express in Python,” at https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express. This is an \\noverview of all the plots you can make with Plotly Express, and you can find \\nlinks to longer articles about each individual chart type.\\nIf you want to understand how to customize Plotly charts better, the \\narticle “Styling Plotly Express Figures in Python” will expand on what you’ve \\nseen in Chapters 15–17. You can find this article at https://plotly.com/python/ \\nstyling-plotly-express .\\nFor more about the GitHub API, refer to its documentation at https://\\ndocs.github.com/en/rest. Here you’ll learn how to pull a wide variety of infor -\\nmation from GitHub. To expand on what you saw in this project, look for \\nthe Search section of the reference in the sidebar.

On Hacker News, people share \\narticles about programming and technology and engage in lively discus -\\nsions about those articles. The Hacker News API provides access to data \\nabout all submissions and comments on the site, and you can use the API \\nwithout having to register for a key.\\nThe following call returns information about the current top article as \\nof this writing:\\nhttps://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/31353677.json\\nWhen you enter this URL in a browser, you’ll see that the text on the \\npage is enclosed by braces, meaning it’s a dictionary. But the response is \\ndifficult to examine without some better formatting. Let’s run this URL \\nthrough the json.dumps() method, like we did in the earthquake project \\nin Chapter\\xa016, so we can explore the kind of information that’s returned \\nabout an article:\\nhn_article.py import requests\\nimport json\\n# Make an API call, and store the response.\\nurl = \"https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/31353677.json\"\\nr = requests.get(url)\\nprint(f\"Status code: {r.status_code}\")\\n# Explore the structure of the data.\\nresponse_dict = r.json()\\nresponse_string = json.dumps(response_dict, indent=4)\\n1 print(response_string)'),\n",

In  \\nthis chapter, you’ll learn how to use Django to build a project called Learning \\nLog, an online journal system that lets you keep track of information you’ve \\nlearned about different topics.\\nWe’ll write a specification for this project, and then define models for \\nthe data the app will work with. We’ll use Django’s admin system to enter \\nsome initial data, and then write views and templates so Django can build \\nthe site’s pages.\\nDjango can respond to page requests and make it easier to read and \\nwrite to a database, manage users, and much more.

Once you have a clear \\nset of goals, you can start to identify manageable tasks to achieve those \\ngoals.\\nIn this section, we’ll write a spec for Learning Log and start working on \\nthe first phase of the project. This will involve setting up a virtual environ -\\nment and building out the initial aspects of a Django project.\\nWriting a Spec\\nA full spec details the project goals, describes the project’s functionality, \\nand discusses its appearance and user interface. Like any good project or \\nbusiness plan, a spec should keep you focused and help keep your project \\non track. We won’t write a full project spec here, but we’ll lay out a few clear \\ngoals to keep the development process focused. Here’s the spec we’ll use:\\nWe’ll write a web app called Learning Log that allows users to \\nlog the topics they’re interested in and make journal entries as \\nthey learn about each topic. The Learning Log home page will \\ndescribe the site and invite users to either register or log in. Once \\nlogged in, a user can create new topics, add new entries, and read \\nand edit existing entries.\\nWhen you’re researching a new topic, maintaining a journal of what \\nyou’ve learned can help you keep track of new information and informa -\\ntion you’ve already found. This is especially true when studying technical \\nsubjects. A good app, like the one we’ll be creating, can help make this \\nprocess more efficient.\\nCreating a Virtual Environment\\nTo work with Django, we’ll first set up a virtual environment. A virtual envi-\\nronment is a place on your system where you can install packages and isolate \\nthem from all other Python packages. Separating one project’s libraries \\nfrom other projects is beneficial and will be necessary when we deploy \\nLearning Log to a server in Chapter\\xa020.\\nCreate a new directory for your project called learning_log , switch to \\nthat directory in a terminal, and enter the following code to create a virtual \\nenvironment:\\nlearning_log$ python -m venv ll_env\\nlearning_log$\\nHere we’re running the venv virtual environment module and using \\nit to create an environment named ll_env  (note that this name starts with'),\n",

When the environ-\\nment is active, you’ll see the name of the environment in parentheses.

For now, we’ll create one app to do \\nmost of our project’s work. We’ll add another app in Chapter\\xa019 to manage \\nuser accounts.\\nYou should leave the development server running in the terminal win -\\ndow you opened earlier. Open a new terminal window (or tab) and navigate \\nto the directory that contains manage.py.

Use the ls command to see what \\nDjango has created\\xa02. The most important files are models.py, admin.py, and \\nviews.py . We’ll use models.py to define the data we want to manage in our \\napp. We’ll look at admin.py and views.py a little later.\\nDefining Models\\nLet’s think about our data for a moment. Each user will need to create a \\nnumber of topics in their learning log. Each entry they make will be tied to a \\ntopic, and these entries will be displayed as text. We’ll also need to store the \\ntimestamp of each entry so we can show users when they made each one.\\nOpen the file models.py and look at its existing content:\\nmodels.py from django.db import models\\n# Create your models here.\\nA module called models is being imported, and we’re being invited to \\ncreate models of our own. A model tells Django how to work with the data \\nthat will be stored in the app. A model is a class; it has attributes and meth -\\nods, just like every class we’ve discussed. Here’s the model for the topics \\nusers will store:\\nfrom django.db import models\\nclass Topic(models.Model):\\n    \"\"\"A topic the user is learning about.\"\"\"\\n1     text = models.CharField(max_length=200)\\n2     date_added = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)'),\n",

We add \\ntwo attributes to the Topic class: text and date_added.\\nThe text attribute is a CharField, a piece of data that’s made up of char-\\nacters or text\\xa01. You use CharField when you want to store a small amount of \\ntext, such as a name, a title, or a city. When we define a CharField attribute, \\nwe have to tell Django how much space it should reserve in the database. \\nHere we give it a max_length of 200 characters, which should be enough to \\nhold most topic names.\\nThe date_added attribute is a DateTimeField, a piece of data that will \\nrecord a date and time\\xa02. We pass the argument auto_now_add=True, which \\ntells Django to automatically set this attribute to the current date and time \\nwhenever the user creates a new topic.\\nIt’s a good idea to tell Django how you want it to represent an instance \\nof a model. If a model has a __str__() method, Django calls that method \\nwhenever it needs to generate output referring to an instance of that model. \\nHere we’ve written a __str__() method that returns the value assigned to the \\ntext attribute\\xa03.\\nTo see the different kinds of fields you can use in a model, see the \\n“Model Field Reference” page at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/\\nmodels/fields . You won’t need all the information right now, but it will be \\nextremely useful when you’re developing your own Django projects.\\nActivating Models\\nTo use our models, we have to tell Django to include our app in the overall \\nproject. Open settings.py (in the ll_project directory); you’ll see a section that \\ntells Django which apps are installed in the project:\\nsettings.py --snip--\\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\\n    \\'django.contrib.admin\\',\\n    \\'django.contrib.auth\\',\\n    \\'django.contrib.contenttypes\\',\\n    \\'django.contrib.sessions\\',\\n    \\'django.contrib.messages\\',\\n    \\'django.contrib.staticfiles\\',\\n]\\n--snip--\\nAdd our app to this list by modifying INSTALLED_APPS so it looks like this:\\n--snip--\\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\\n    # My apps.\\n    \\'learning_logs\\','),\n",

Here we start a section called My apps, \\nwhich includes only 'learning_logs' for now. It’s important to place your own \\napps before the default apps, in case you need to override any behavior of \\nthe default apps with your own custom behavior.\\nNext, we need to tell Django to modify the database so it can store \\ninformation related to the model Topic. From the terminal, run the follow -\\ning command:\\n(ll_env)learning_log$ python manage.py makemigrations learning_logs\\nMigrations for 'learning_logs':\\n  learning_logs/migrations/0001_initial.py\\n    - Create model Topic\\n(ll_env)learning_log$\\nThe command makemigrations tells Django to figure out how to modify \\nthe database so it can store the data associated with any new models we’ve \\ndefined. The output here shows that Django has created a migration file \\ncalled 0001_initial.py. This migration will create a table for the model Topic \\nin the database.\\nNow we’ll apply this migration and have Django modify the database \\nfor us:\\n(ll_env)learning_log$ python manage.py migrate\\nOperations to perform:\\n  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, learning_logs, sessions\\nRunning migrations:\\n  Applying learning_logs.0001_initial...

We need to check the last line \\nin this output, where Django confirms that the migration for learning_logs \\nworked OK.\\nWhenever we want to modify the data that Learning Log manages, we’ll \\nfollow these three steps: modify models.py, call makemigrations on learning_logs, \\nand tell Django to migrate the project.\\nThe Django Admin Site\\nDjango makes it easy to work with your models through its admin site. Django’s \\nadmin site is only meant to be used by the site’s administrators; it’s not meant for \\nregular users. In this section, we’ll set up the admin site and use it to add some \\ntopics through the Topic model.\"),\n",

A user’s privileges control the actions they can take. The \\nmost restrictive privilege settings allow a user to only read public informa -\\ntion on the site. Registered users typically have the privilege of reading \\ntheir own private data and some selected information available only to \\nmembers. To effectively administer a project, the site owner usually needs \\naccess to all information stored on the site. A good administrator is careful \\nwith their users’ sensitive information, because users put a lot of trust into \\nthe apps they access.\\nTo create a superuser in Django, enter the following command and \\nrespond to the prompts:\\n(ll_env)learning_log$ python manage.py createsuperuser\\n1 Username (leave blank to use 'eric'): ll_admin\\n2 Email address:\\n3 Password:\\nPassword (again):\\nSuperuser created successfully.\\n(ll_env)learning_log$\\nWhen you issue the command createsuperuser, Django prompts you to \\nenter a username for the superuser\\xa01. Here I’m using ll_admin, but you can \\nenter any username you want. You can enter an email address or just leave \\nthis field blank\\xa02. You’ll need to enter your password twice\\xa03.\\nNOTE  Some sensitive information can be hidden from a site’s administrators. For example, \\nDjango doesn’t store the password you enter; instead, it stores a string derived from \\nthe password, called a hash. Each time you enter your password, Django hashes your \\nentry and compares it to the stored hash. If the two hashes match, you’re authenti -\\ncated. By requiring hashes to match, Django ensures that if an attacker gains access to \\na site’s database, they’ll be able to read the stored hashes but not the passwords. When \\na site is set up properly, it’s almost impossible to get the original passwords from the \\nhashes.\\nRegistering a Model with the Admin Site\\nDjango includes some models in the admin site automatically, such as User \\nand Group, but the models we create need to be added manually.\\nWhen we started the learning_logs app, Django created an admin.py file \\nin the same directory as models.py. Open the admin.py file:\\nadmin.py from django.contrib import admin\\n# Register your models here.\"),\n",

Each entry needs to be associated with a particular \\ntopic. This relationship is called a many-to-one relationship , meaning many \\nentries can be associated with one topic.\\nHere’s the code for the Entry model. Place it in your models.py file:\\nmodels.py from django.db import models\\nclass Topic(models.Model):\\n    --snip--\\n1 class Entry(models.Model):\\n    \"\"\"Something specific learned about a topic.\"\"\"\\n2     topic = models.ForeignKey(Topic, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\\n3     text = models.TextField()\\n    date_added = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\\n4     class Meta:\\n        verbose_name_plural = \\'entries\\'\\n    def __str__(self):\\n        \"\"\"Return a simple string representing the entry.\"\"\"\\n5         return f\"{self.text[:50]}...\"\\nThe Entry class inherits from Django’s base Model class, just as Topic \\ndid\\xa01. The first attribute, topic, is a ForeignKey instance\\xa02. A foreign key is a \\ndatabase term; it’s a reference to another record in the database. This is the \\ncode that connects each entry to a specific topic. Each topic is assigned a \\nkey, or ID, when it’s created. When Django needs to establish a connection \\nbetween two pieces of data, it uses the keys associated with each piece of \\ninformation. We’ll use these connections shortly to retrieve all the entries \\nassociated with a certain topic. The on_delete=models.CASCADE argument tells \\nDjango that when a topic is deleted, all the entries associated with that topic \\nshould be deleted as well. This is known as a cascading delete.\\nNext is an attribute called text, which is an instance of TextField\\xa03. \\nThis kind of field doesn’t need a size limit, because we don’t want to limit \\nthe size of individual entries. The date_added attribute allows us to present \\nentries in the order they were created, and to place a timestamp next to \\neach entry.\\nThe Meta class is nested inside the Entry class\\xa04. The Meta class holds \\nextra information for managing a model; here, it lets us set a special attri -\\nbute telling Django to use Entries when it needs to refer to more than one \\nentry. Without this, Django would refer to multiple entries as Entrys.\\nThe __str__() method tells Django which information to show when \\nit refers to individual entries. Because an entry can be a long body of text, \\n__str__() returns just the first 50 characters of text\\xa05. We also add an ellipsis \\nto clarify that we’re not always displaying the entire entry.'),\n",

This interactive environment is \\ncalled the Django shell, and it’s a great environment for testing and trouble-\\nshooting your project. Here’s an example of an interactive shell session:\\n(ll_env)learning_log$ python manage.py shell\\n1 >>> from learning_logs.models import Topic\\n>>> Topic.objects.all()\\n<QuerySet [<Topic: Chess>, <Topic: Rock Climbing>]>\\nThe command python manage.py shell, run in an active virtual environ -\\nment, launches a Python interpreter that you can use to explore the data \\nstored in your project’s database. Here, we import the model Topic from  \\nthe learning_logs.models module\\xa01. We then use the method Topic.objects \\n.all() to get all instances of the model Topic; the list that’s returned is \\ncalled a queryset.\\nWe can loop over a queryset just as we’d loop over a list. Here’s how you \\ncan see the ID that’s been assigned to each topic object:\\n>>> topics = Topic.objects.all()\\n>>> for topic in topics:\\n...     print(topic.id, topic)\\n...\\n1 Chess\\n2 Rock Climbing\\nWe assign the queryset to topics and then print each topic’s id attribute \\nand the string representation of each topic.

Let’s look at the text and date_added values for Chess:\\n>>> t = Topic.objects.get(id=1)\\n>>> t.text\\n'Chess'\\n>>> t.date_added\\ndatetime.datetime(2022, 5, 20, 3, 33, 36, 928759,\\n    tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)\\nWe can also look at the entries related to a certain topic. Earlier, we \\ndefined the topic attribute for the Entry model. This was a ForeignKey, a con-\\nnection between each entry and a topic. Django can use this connection to \\nget every entry related to a certain topic, like this:\\n1 >>> t.entry_set.all()\\n<QuerySet [<Entry: The opening is the first part of the game, roughly...>, \\n<Entry:\\nIn the opening phase of the game, it's important t...>]>\\nTo get data through a foreign key relationship, you use the lowercase \\nname of the related model followed by an underscore and the word set\\xa01. \\nFor example, say you have the models Pizza and Topping, and Topping is \\nrelated to Pizza through a foreign key.

The shell is really useful for making sure your code retrieves the \\ndata you want it to. If your code works as you expect it to in the shell, it \\nshould also work properly in the files within your project.

Define a model called Topping with \\nfields called pizza and name. The pizza field should be a foreign key to Pizza, \\nand name should be able to hold values such as pineapple, Canadian bacon, and \\nsausage.\\nRegister both models with the admin site, and use the site to enter some \\npizza names and toppings. Use the shell to explore the data you entered.\\nMaking Pages: The Learning Log Home Page\\nMaking web pages with Django consists of three stages: defining URLs, \\nwriting views, and writing templates. You can do these in any order, but in \\nthis project we’ll always start by defining the URL pattern. A URL pattern  \\ndescribes the way the URL is laid out. It also tells Django what to look for \\nwhen matching a browser request with a site URL, so it knows which page \\nto return.\\nEach URL then maps to a particular view. The view function retrieves \\nand processes the data needed for that page. The view function often ren -\\nders the page using a template , which contains the overall structure of the \\npage. To see how this works, let’s make the home page for Learning Log. \\nWe’ll define the URL for the home page, write its view function, and create \\na simple template.\\nBecause we just want to ensure that Learning Log works as it’s supposed \\nto, we’ll make a simple page for now. A functioning web app is fun to style \\nwhen it’s complete; an app that looks good but doesn’t work well is point-\\nless. For now, the home page will display only a title and a brief description.\\nMapping a URL\\nUsers request pages by entering URLs into a browser and clicking links, so \\nwe’ll need to decide what URLs are needed. The home page URL is first: \\nit’s the base URL people use to access the project.

The first argument is a string that helps Django route \\nthe current request properly. Django receives the requested URL and tries \\nto route the request to a view. It does this by searching all the URL patterns \\nwe’ve defined to find one that matches the current request. Django ignores \\nthe base URL for the project ( http://localhost:8000/ ), so the empty string \\n(\\'\\') matches the base URL. Any other URL won’t match this pattern, and \\nDjango will return an error page if the URL requested doesn’t match any \\nexisting URL patterns.\\nThe second argument in path()\\xa06 specifies which function to call \\nin views.py . When a requested URL matches the pattern we’re defining, \\nDjango calls the index() function from views.py. (We’ll write this view func -\\ntion in the next section.) The third argument provides the name index for \\nthis URL pattern so we can refer to it more easily in other files throughout \\nthe project. Whenever we want to provide a link to the home page, we’ll use \\nthis name instead of writing out a URL.\\nWriting a View\\nA view function takes in information from a request, prepares the data \\nneeded to generate a page, and then sends the data back to the browser. It \\noften does this by using a template that defines what the page will look like.\\nThe file views.py in learning_logs was generated automatically when we ran \\nthe command python manage.py startapp. Here’s what’s in views.py right now:\\nviews.py from django.shortcuts import render\\n# Create your views here.\\nCurrently, this file just imports the render() function, which renders the \\nresponse based on the data provided by views. Open views.py and add the \\nfollowing code for the home page:\\nfrom django.shortcuts import render\\ndef index(request):\\n    \"\"\"The home page for Learning Log.\"\"\"\\n    return render(request, \\'learning_logs/index.html\\')\\nWhen a URL request matches the pattern we just defined, Django looks \\nfor a function called index() in the views.py file. Django then passes the \\nrequest object to this view function. In this case, we don’t need to process any \\ndata for the page, so the only code in the function is a call to render(). The \\nrender() function here passes two arguments: the original request object and \\na template it can use to build the page.

Pizzeria Home Page: Add a home page to the Pizzeria project you \\nstarted in Exercise 18-4 (page 388).\\nBuilding Additional Pages\\nNow that we’ve established a routine for building a page, we can start to \\nbuild out the Learning Log project. We’ll build two pages that display data: \\na page that lists all topics and a page that shows all the entries for a particu -\\nlar topic. For each page, we’ll specify a URL pattern, write a view function, \\nand write a template. But before we do this, we’ll create a base template \\nthat all templates in the project can inherit from.\\nTemplate Inheritance\\nWhen building a website, some elements will need to be repeated on each \\npage. Rather than writing these elements directly into each page, you can \\nwrite a base template containing the repeated elements and then have each \\npage inherit from the base. This approach lets you focus on developing the \\nunique aspects of each page, and makes it much easier to change the over -\\nall look and feel of the project.\\nThe Parent Template\\nWe’ll create a template called base.html in the same directory as index.html. \\nThis file will contain elements common to all pages; every other template \\nwill inherit from base.html . The only element we want to repeat on each \\npage right now is the title at the top. Because we’ll include this template \\non every page, let’s make the title a link to the home page:\\nbase.html <p>\\n1   <a href=\"{% url \\'learning_logs:index\\' %}\">Learning Log</a>'),\n",

To generate a link, we use \\na template tag, which is indicated by braces and percent signs ({% %}). A tem-\\nplate tag generates information to be displayed on a page. The template \\ntag {% url \\'learning_logs:index\\' %}  shown here generates a URL matching \\nthe URL pattern defined in learning_logs/urls.py with the name \\'index\\'\\xa01. In \\nthis example, learning_logs is the namespace and index is a uniquely named \\nURL pattern in that namespace. The namespace comes from the value we \\nassigned to app_name in the learning_logs/urls.py file.\\nIn a simple HTML page, a link is surrounded by the anchor tag <a>:\\n<a href=\"link_url\">link text</a>\\nHaving the template tag generate the URL for us makes it much easier \\nto keep our links up to date. We only need to change the URL pattern in \\nurls.py, and Django will automatically insert the updated URL the next time \\nthe page is requested. Every page in our project will inherit from base.html, \\nso from now on, every page will have a link back to the home page.\\nOn the last line, we insert a pair of block tags\\xa02. This block, named content, \\nis a placeholder; the child template will define the kind of information that \\ngoes in the content block.\\nA child template doesn’t have to define every block from its parent, so \\nyou can reserve space in parent templates for as many blocks as you like; the \\nchild template uses only as many as it needs.\\nNOTE  In Python code, we almost always use four spaces when we indent. Template files tend \\nto have more levels of nesting than Python files, so it’s common to use only two spaces \\nfor each indentation level.\\nThe Child Template\\nNow we need to rewrite index.html to inherit from base.html. Add the follow-\\ning code to index.html:\\nindex.html 1 {% extends \\'learning_logs/base.html\\' %}\\n2 {% block content %}\\n  <p>Learning Log helps you keep track of your learning, for any topic you\\'re\\n  interested in.</p>\\n3 {% endblock content %}\\nIf you compare this to the original index.html , you can see that we’ve \\nreplaced the Learning Log title with the code for inheriting from a parent \\ntemplate\\xa01. A child template must have an {% extends %} tag on the first \\nline to tell Django which parent template to inherit from. The file base.html'),\n",

This line pulls in everything contained in the base.html template \\nand allows index.html to define what goes in the space reserved by the content \\nblock.\\nWe define the content block by inserting a {% block %} tag with the \\nname content\\xa02. Everything that we aren’t inheriting from the parent tem -\\nplate goes inside the content block. Here, that’s the paragraph describing \\nthe Learning Log project. We indicate that we’re finished defining the con -\\ntent by using an {% endblock content %} tag\\xa03. The {% endblock %} tag doesn’t \\nrequire a name, but if a template grows to contain multiple blocks, it can be \\nhelpful to know exactly which block is ending.\\nYou can start to see the benefit of template inheritance: in a child \\ntemplate, we only need to include content that’s unique to that page. This \\nnot only simplifies each template, but also makes it much easier to modify \\nthe site. To modify an element common to many pages, you only need to \\nmodify the parent template. Your changes are then carried over to every \\npage that inherits from that template. In a project that includes tens or \\nhundreds of pages, this structure can make it much easier and faster to \\nimprove your site.\\nIn a large project, it’s common to have one parent template called base \\n.html for the entire site and parent templates for each major section of the \\nsite. All the section templates inherit from base.html , and each page in  \\nthe site inherits from a section template. This way you can easily modify the \\nlook and feel of the site as a whole, any section in the site, or any individual \\npage. This configuration provides a very efficient way to work, and encour -\\nages you to steadily update your project over time.\\nThe Topics Page\\nNow that we have an efficient approach to building pages, we can focus on \\nour next two pages: the general topics page and the page to display entries \\nfor a single topic. The topics page will show all topics that users have cre -\\nated, and it’s the first page that will involve working with data.\\nThe Topics URL Pattern\\nFirst, we define the URL for the topics page. It’s common to choose a sim -\\nple URL fragment that reflects the kind of information presented on the \\npage. We’ll use the word topics, so the URL http://localhost:8000/topics/ will \\nreturn this page. Here’s how we modify learning_logs/urls.py:\\nlearning_logs/ \\nurls.py\\n\"\"\"Defines URL patterns for learning_logs.\"\"\"\\n--snip--\\nurlpatterns = [\\n    # Home page\\n    path(\\'\\', views.index, name=\\'index\\'),\\n    # Page that shows all topics.\\n    path(\\'topics/\\', views.topics, name=\\'topics\\'),\\n]'),\n",

You can include or omit a forward \\nslash at the end, but there can’t be anything else after the word topics, or the \\npattern won’t match. Any request with a URL that matches this pattern will \\nthen be passed to the function topics() in views.py.\\nThe Topics View\\nThe topics() function needs to retrieve some data from the database and \\nsend it to the template. Add the following to views.py:\\nviews.py from django.shortcuts import render\\n1 from .models import Topic\\ndef index(request):\\n    --snip--\\n2 def topics(request):\\n    \"\"\"Show all topics.\"\"\"\\n3     topics = Topic.objects.order_by(\\'date_added\\')\\n4     context = {\\'topics\\': topics}\\n5     return render(request, \\'learning_logs/topics.html\\', context)\\nWe first import the model associated with the data we need\\xa0 1. The \\ntopics() function needs one parameter: the request object Django received \\nfrom the server\\xa02. We query the database by asking for the Topic objects, \\nsorted by the date_added attribute\\xa03. We assign the resulting queryset to \\ntopics.\\nWe then define a context that we’ll send to the template\\xa04. A context is \\na dictionary in which the keys are names we’ll use in the template to access \\nthe data we want, and the values are the data we need to send to the tem -\\nplate. In this case, there’s one key-value pair, which contains the set of topics \\nwe’ll display on the page. When building a page that uses data, we call \\nrender() with the request object, the template we want to use, and the  \\ncontext dictionary\\xa0 5.\\nThe Topics Template\\nThe template for the topics page receives the context dictionary, so the tem-\\nplate can use the data that topics() provides. Make a file called topics.html in \\nthe same directory as index.html. Here’s how we can display the topics in the \\ntemplate:\\ntopics.html {% extends \\'learning_logs/base.html\\' %}\\n{% block content %}\\n  <p>Topics</p>'),\n",

The body of this page \\ncontains a bulleted list of the topics that have been entered. In standard \\nHTML, a bulleted list is called an unordered list and is indicated by the tags \\n<ul></ul>. The opening tag <ul> begins the bulleted list of topics\\xa0 1.\\nNext we use a template tag that’s equivalent to a for loop, which loops \\nthrough the list topics from the context dictionary\\xa02. The code used in tem-\\nplates differs from Python in some important ways. Python uses indentation \\nto indicate which lines of a for statement are part of a loop. In a template, \\nevery for loop needs an explicit {% endfor %} tag indicating where the end of \\nthe loop occurs. So in a template, you’ll see loops written like this:\\n{% for item in list %}\\n  do something with each item\\n{% endfor %}\\nInside the loop, we want to turn each topic into an item in the bulleted \\nlist. To print a variable in a template, wrap the variable name in double \\nbraces. The braces won’t appear on the page; they just indicate to Django \\nthat we’re using a template variable. So the code {{ topic.text }}\\xa03 will \\nbe replaced by the value of the current topic’s text attribute on each pass \\nthrough the loop. The HTML tag <li></li> indicates a list item. Anything \\nbetween these tags, inside a pair of <ul></ul> tags, will appear as a bulleted \\nitem in the list.\\nWe also use the {% empty %} template tag\\xa04, which tells Django what to \\ndo if there are no items in the list. In this case, we print a message inform -\\ning the user that no topics have been added yet. The last two lines close out \\nthe for loop\\xa05 and then close out the bulleted list\\xa06.\\nNow we need to modify the base template to include a link to the topics \\npage. Add the following code to base.html:\\nbase.html <p>\\n1   <a href=\"{% url \\'learning_logs:index\\' %}\">Learning Log</a> -\\n2   <a href=\"{% url \\'learning_logs:topics\\' %}\">Topics</a>\\n</p>\\n{% block content %}{% endblock content %}\\nWe add a dash after the link to the home page\\xa01, and then add a link \\nto the topics page using the {% url %} template tag again\\xa02.

For example, if the user wants to see the detail page \\nfor the Chess topic (where the id is 1), the URL will be http://localhost: \\n8000/topics/1/. Here’s a pattern to match this URL, which you should place \\nin learning_logs/urls.py :\\nlearning_logs/ \\nurls.py\\n--snip--\\nurlpatterns = [\\n    --snip--\\n    # Detail page for a single topic.\\n    path('topics/<int:topic_id>/', views.topic, name='topic'),\\n]\\nLet’s examine the string 'topics/<int:topic_id>/' in this URL pattern. \\nThe first part of the string tells Django to look for URLs that have the word \\ntopics after the base URL.

The function accepts the value captured by the expression \\n/<int:topic_id>/ and assigns it to topic_id\\xa01. Then we use get() to retrieve \\nthe topic, just as we did in the Django shell\\xa02. Next, we get all of the entries \\nassociated with this topic and order them according to date_added\\xa03. The \\nminus sign in front of date_added sorts the results in reverse order, which will \\ndisplay the most recent entries first. We store the topic and entries in the \\ncontext dictionary\\xa04 and call render() with the request object, the topic.html \\ntemplate, and the context dictionary\\xa05.\\nNOTE  The code phrases at\\xa02 and\\xa03 are called queries, because they query the database for \\nspecific information.

You set up an app and defined models to rep-\\nresent the data for your app. You learned about databases and how Django \\nhelps you migrate your database after you make a change to your models. \\nYou created a superuser for the admin site, and you used the admin site to \\nenter some initial data.\\nYou also explored the Django shell, which allows you to work with your \\nproject’s data in a terminal session. You learned how to define URLs, cre -\\nate view functions, and write templates to make pages for your site. You also \\nused template inheritance to simplify the structure of individual templates \\nand make it easier to modify the site as the project evolves.'),\n",

We’ll give users the \\nability to add a new topic, add a new entry, and edit their previous entries.\\nCurrently, only a superuser can enter data through the admin site. We \\ndon’t want users to interact with the admin site, so we’ll use Django’s form-\\nbuilding tools to build pages that allow users to enter data.\\nAdding New Topics\\nLet’s start by allowing users to add a new topic. Adding a form-based page \\nworks in much the same way as adding the pages we’ve already built: we \\ndefine a URL, write a view function, and write a template. The one signifi -\\ncant difference is the addition of a new module called forms.py, which will \\ncontain the forms.\\nThe Topic ModelForm\\nAny page that lets a user enter and submit information on a web page involves \\nan HTML element called a form. When users enter information, we need to \\nvalidate that the information provided is the right kind of data and is not mali-\\ncious, such as code designed to interrupt our server. We then need to process \\nand save valid information to the appropriate place in the database. Django \\nautomates much of this work.\\nThe simplest way to build a form in Django is to use a ModelForm, which \\nuses the information from the models we defined in Chapter\\xa018 to build a \\nform automatically. Write your first form in the file forms.py, which should \\nbe created in the same directory as models.py:\\nforms.py from django import forms\\nfrom .models import Topic\\n1 class TopicForm(forms.ModelForm):\\n    class Meta:\\n2         model = Topic\\n3         fields = ['text']\\n4         labels = {'text': ''}\\nWe first import the forms module and the model we’ll work with, \\nTopic. We then define a class called TopicForm, which inherits from forms \\n.ModelForm\\xa01.\\nThe simplest version of a ModelForm consists of a nested Meta class telling \\nDjango which model to base the form on and which fields to include in the \\nform. Here we specify that the form should be based on the Topic model\\xa02, \\nand that it should only include the text field\\xa03. The empty string in the \\nlabels dictionary tells Django not to generate a label for the text field\\xa04.\"),\n",

When the \\nuser wants to add a new topic, we’ll send them to http://localhost:8000/\\nnew_topic/. Here’s the URL pattern for the new_topic page; add this to \\nlearning_logs/urls.py :\\nlearning_logs/ \\nurls.py\\n--snip--\\nurlpatterns = [\\n    --snip--\\n    # Page for adding a new topic.\\n    path(\\'new_topic/\\', views.new_topic, name=\\'new_topic\\'),\\n]\\nThis URL pattern sends requests to the view function new_topic(), which \\nwe’ll write next.\\nThe new_topic() View Function\\nThe new_topic() function needs to handle two different situations: ini -\\ntial requests for the new_topic page, in which case it should show a blank \\nform; and the processing of any data submitted in the form. After data \\nfrom a submitted form is processed, it needs to redirect the user back to \\nthe topics page:\\nviews.py from django.shortcuts import render, redirect\\nfrom .models import Topic\\nfrom .forms import TopicForm\\n--snip--\\ndef new_topic(request):\\n    \"\"\"Add a new topic.\"\"\"\\n1     if request.method != \\'POST\\':\\n        # No data submitted; create a blank form.\\n2         form = TopicForm()\\n    else:\\n        # POST data submitted; process data.\\n3         form = TopicForm(data=request.POST)\\n4         if form.is_valid():\\n5             form.save()\\n6             return redirect(\\'learning_logs:topics\\')\\n    # Display a blank or invalid form.\\n7     context = {\\'form\\': form}\\n    return render(request, \\'learning_logs/new_topic.html\\', context)\\nWe import the function redirect, which we’ll use to redirect the user \\nback to the topics page after they submit their topic. We also import the \\nform we just wrote, TopicForm.'),\n",

You use GET requests for pages that only read data from the server. \\nYou usually use POST requests when the user needs to submit information \\nthrough a form. We’ll be specifying the POST method for processing all of \\nour forms. (A few other kinds of requests exist, but we won’t use them in \\nthis project.)\\nThe new_topic() function takes in the request object as a parameter. \\nWhen the user initially requests this page, their browser will send a GET \\nrequest. Once the user has filled out and submitted the form, their browser \\nwill submit a POST request. Depending on the request, we’ll know whether \\nthe user is requesting a blank form (GET) or asking us to process a com -\\npleted form (POST).\\nWe use an if test to determine whether the request method is GET or \\nPOST\\xa01. If the request method isn’t POST, the request is probably GET, so \\nwe need to return a blank form. (If it’s another kind of request, it’s still safe \\nto return a blank form.) We make an instance of TopicForm\\xa02, assign it to \\nthe variable form, and send the form to the template in the context diction-\\nary\\xa07. Because we included no arguments when instantiating TopicForm, \\nDjango creates a blank form that the user can fill out.\\nIf the request method is POST, the else block runs and processes the \\ndata submitted in the form. We make an instance of TopicForm\\xa03 and pass \\nit the data entered by the user, which is assigned to request.POST. The form \\nobject that’s returned contains the information submitted by the user.\\nWe can’t save the submitted information in the database until we’ve \\nchecked that it’s valid\\xa0 4. The is_valid() method checks that all required \\nfields have been filled in (all fields in a form are required by default) and \\nthat the data entered matches the field types expected—for example, that \\nthe length of text is less than 200 characters, as we specified in models.py in \\nChapter\\xa018. This automatic validation saves us a lot of work. If everything \\nis valid, we can call save()\\xa05, which writes the data from the form to the \\ndatabase.\\nOnce we’ve saved the data, we can leave this page. The redirect() func-\\ntion takes in the name of a view and redirects the user to the page associated \\nwith that view. Here we use redirect() to redirect the user’s browser to the \\ntopics page\\xa06, where the user should see the topic they just entered in the list \\nof topics.\\nThe context variable is defined at the end of the view function, and the \\npage is rendered using the template new_topic.html, which we’ll create next. \\nThis code is placed outside of any if block; it will run if a blank form was \\ncreated, and it will run if a submitted form is determined to be invalid. An \\ninvalid form will include some default error messages to help the user sub -\\nmit acceptable data.'),\n",

The action argument tells the browser where to send the \\ndata submitted in the form; in this case, we send it back to the view function \\nnew_topic(). The method argument tells the browser to submit the data as a  \\nPOST request.\\nDjango uses the template tag {% csrf_token %}\\xa02 to prevent attackers \\nfrom using the form to gain unauthorized access to the server. (This kind \\nof attack is called a cross-site request forgery .) Next, we display the form; here \\nyou can see how simple Django can make certain tasks, such as displaying \\na form. We only need to include the template variable {{ form.as_div }} \\nfor Django to create all the fields necessary to display the form automati -\\ncally\\xa03.

We \\nmake a new class called EntryForm that inherits from forms.ModelForm. The \\nEntryForm class has a nested Meta class listing the model it’s based on, and the \\nfield to include in the form. We again give the field 'text' a blank label\\xa01.\\nFor EntryForm, we include the widgets attribute\\xa02.

Here we’re telling Django to use a forms.Textarea ele-\\nment with a width of 80 columns, instead of the default 40 columns. This \\ngives users enough room to write a meaningful entry.\\nThe new_entry URL\\nNew entries must be associated with a particular topic, so we need to include \\na topic_id argument in the URL for adding a new entry. Here’s the URL, \\nwhich you add to learning_logs/urls.py:\\nlearning_logs/ \\nurls.py\\n--snip--\\nurlpatterns = [\\n    --snip--\\n    # Page for adding a new entry.\\n    path(\\'new_entry/<int:topic_id>/\\', views.new_entry, name=\\'new_entry\\'),\\n]\\nThis URL pattern matches any URL with the form http://localhost:8000/\\nnew_entry/id/, where id is a number matching the topic ID. The code \\n<int:topic_id> captures a numerical value and assigns it to the variable \\ntopic_id. When a URL matching this pattern is requested, Django sends the \\nrequest and the topic’s ID to the new_entry() view function.\\nThe new_entry() View Function\\nThe view function for new_entry is much like the function for adding a new \\ntopic. Add the following code to your views.py file:\\nviews.py from django.shortcuts import render, redirect\\nfrom .models import Topic\\nfrom .forms import TopicForm, EntryForm\\n--snip--\\ndef new_entry(request, topic_id):\\n    \"\"\"Add a new entry for a particular topic.\"\"\"\\n1     topic = Topic.objects.get(id=topic_id)\\n2     if request.method != \\'POST\\':\\n        # No data submitted; create a blank form.\\n3         form = EntryForm()\\n    else:\\n        # POST data submitted; process data.\\n4         form = EntryForm(data=request.POST)\\n        if form.is_valid():\\n5             new_entry = form.save(commit=False)\\n6             new_entry.topic = topic\\n            new_entry.save()\\n7             return redirect(\\'learning_logs:topic\\', topic_id=topic_id)\\n    # Display a blank or invalid form.\\n    context = {\\'topic\\': topic, \\'form\\': form}\\n    return render(request, \\'learning_logs/new_entry.html\\', context)'),\n",

The \\nif block executes if it’s a GET request, and we create a blank instance of \\nEntryForm\\xa03.\\nIf the request method is POST, we process the data by making an instance \\nof EntryForm, populated with the POST data from the request object\\xa04. We \\nthen check whether the form is valid. If it is, we need to set the entry object’s \\ntopic attribute before saving it to the database. When we call save(), we include \\nthe argument commit=False\\xa05 to tell Django to create a new entry object and \\nassign it to new_entry, without saving it to the database yet. We set the topic \\nattribute of new_entry to the topic we pulled from the database at the begin-\\nning of the function\\xa06.

This code will execute for a blank \\nform, or for a form that’s been submitted but turns out to be invalid.\\nThe new_entry Template\\nAs you can see in the following code, the template for new_entry is similar to \\nthe template for new_topic:\\nnew_entry.html {% extends \"learning_logs/base.html\" %}\\n{% block content %}\\n1   <p><a href=\"{% url \\'learning_logs:topic\\' topic.id %}\">{{ topic }}</a></p>\\n  <p>Add a new entry:</p>\\n2   <form action=\"{% url \\'learning_logs:new_entry\\' topic.id %}\" method=\\'post\\'>\\n    {% csrf_token %}\\n    {{ form.as_div }}\\n    <button name=\\'submit\\'>Add entry</button>\\n  </form>\\n{% endblock content %}\\nWe show the topic at the top of the page\\xa01, so the user can see which \\ntopic they’re adding an entry to.

We’ll start by restricting access to certain pages.\\nRestricting Access with @login_required\\nDjango makes it easy to restrict access to certain pages through the @login \\n_required decorator. Recall from Chapter\\xa011 that a decorator is a directive \\nplaced just before a function definition, which modifies how the function \\nbehaves. Let’s look at an example.\\nRestricting Access to the Topics Page\\nEach topic will be owned by a user, so only registered users can request the \\ntopics page. Add the following code to learning_logs/views.py:\\nlearning_logs/ \\nviews.py\\nfrom django.shortcuts import render, redirect\\nfrom django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required\\nfrom .models import Topic, Entry\\n--snip--\\n@login_required\\ndef topics(request):\\n    \"\"\"Show all topics.\"\"\"\\n    --snip--'),\n",

We apply login_required() \\nas a decorator to the topics() view function by prepending login_required \\nwith the @ symbol. As a result, Python knows to run the code in login \\n_required() before the code in topics().\\nThe code in login_required() checks whether a user is logged in, and \\nDjango runs the code in topics() only if they are. If the user isn’t logged in, \\nthey’re redirected to the login page.\\nTo make this redirect work, we need to modify settings.py so Django knows \\nwhere to find the login page. Add the following at the end of settings.py:\\nsettings.py --snip--\\n# My settings.\\nLOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'learning_logs:index'\\nLOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = 'learning_logs:index'\\nLOGIN_URL = 'accounts:login'\\nNow when an unauthenticated user requests a page protected by the  \\n@login_required decorator, Django will send the user to the URL defined by \\nLOGIN_URL in settings.py.\\nYou can test this setting by logging out of any user accounts and going \\nto the home page. Click the Topics link, which should redirect you to the \\nlogin page. Then log in to any of your accounts, and from the home page, \\nclick the Topics link again. You should be able to access the topics page.\\nRestricting Access Throughout Learning Log\\nDjango makes it easy to restrict access to pages, but you have to decide which \\npages to protect. It’s best to think about which pages need to be unrestricted \\nfirst, and then restrict all the other pages in the project. You can easily cor-\\nrect over-restricted access, and it’s less dangerous than leaving sensitive \\npages unrestricted.\\nIn Learning Log, we’ll keep the home page and the registration page \\nunrestricted. We’ll restrict access to every other page.\\nHere’s learning_logs/views.py with @login_required decorators applied to \\nevery view except index():\\nlearning_logs/ \\nviews.py\\n--snip--\\n@login_required\\ndef topics(request):\\n    --snip--\\n@login_required\\ndef topic(request, topic_id):\\n    --snip--\\n@login_required\\ndef new_topic(request):\\n    --snip--\"),\n",

We only need \\nto connect the data highest in the hierarchy to a user, and the lower-level data \\nwill follow.

We’ll then have to migrate the database. Finally, we’ll modify some of the \\nviews so they only show the data associated with the currently logged-in user.\\nModifying the Topic Model\\nThe modification to models.py is just two lines:\\nmodels.py from django.db import models\\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\\nclass Topic(models.Model):\\n   \"\"\"A topic the user is learning about.\"\"\"\\n    Text = models.CharField(max_length=200)\\n    date_added = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\\n    owner = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\\n    def __str__(self):\\n        \"\"\"Return a string representing the topic.\"\"\"\\n        Return self.text\\nclass Entry(models.Model):\\n    --snip--\\nWe import the User model from django.contrib.auth.

To make the migration, \\nDjango needs to know which user to associate with each existing topic. The \\nsimplest approach is to start by assigning all existing topics to one user—for \\nexample, the superuser. But first, we need to know that user’s ID.\\nLet’s look at the IDs of all users created so far. Start a Django shell ses -\\nsion and issue the following commands:\\n(ll_env)learning_log$ python manage.py shell\\n1 >>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User\\n2 >>> User.objects.all()\\n<QuerySet [<User: ll_admin>, <User: eric>, <User: willie>]>\\n3 >>> for user in User.objects.all():\\n...     print(user.username, user.id)\\n...\\nll_admin 1\\neric 2\\nwillie 3\\n>>>\\nWe first import the User model into the shell session\\xa01. We then look at \\nall the users that have been created so far\\xa0 2. The output shows three users \\nfor my version of the project: ll_admin, eric, and willie.\\nNext, we loop through the list of users and print each user’s username \\nand ID\\xa03. When Django asks which user to associate the existing topics \\nwith, we’ll use one of these ID values.\\nMigrating the Database\\nNow that we know the IDs, we can migrate the database. When we do this, \\nPython will ask us to connect the Topic model to a particular owner tempo -\\nrarily or to add a default to our models.py file to tell it what to do. Choose \\noption 1:\\n1 (ll_env)learning_log$ python manage.py makemigrations learning_logs\\n2 It is impossible to add a non-nullable field 'owner' to topic without\\nspecifying a default.

(If you get an error when \\nyou run this code, try exiting the shell and starting a new shell.)\\nNOTE  You can simply reset the database instead of migrating, but that will lose all existing \\ndata.

Because \\nwe’re not changing how the topics are displayed, we don’t need to change \\nthe template for the topics page at all.\\nTo see if this works, log in as the user you connected all existing topics \\nto, and go to the topics page. You should see all the topics. Now log out and \\nlog back in as a different user. You should see the message “No topics have \\nbeen added yet.”\\nProtecting a User’s Topics\\nWe haven’t restricted access to the topic pages yet, so any registered user \\ncould try a bunch of URLs (like http://localhost:8000/topics/1/) and retrieve \\ntopic pages that happen to match.\\nTry it yourself. While logged in as the user that owns all topics, copy the \\nURL or note the ID in the URL of a topic, and then log out and log back in \\nas a different user. Enter that topic’s URL. You should be able to read the \\nentries, even though you’re logged in as a different user.\\nWe’ll fix this now by performing a check before retrieving the requested \\nentries in the topic() view function:\\nlearning_logs/ \\nviews.py\\nfrom django.shortcuts import render, redirect\\nfrom django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required\\n1 from django.http import Http404\\n--snip--\\n@login_required\\ndef topic(request, topic_id):\\n    \"\"\"Show a single topic and all its entries.\"\"\"\\n    topic = Topic.objects.get(id=topic_id)\\n    # Make sure the topic belongs to the current user.\\n2     if topic.owner != request.user:\\n        raise Http404\\n    entries = topic.entry_set.order_by(\\'-date_added\\')\\n    context = {\\'topic\\': topic, \\'entries\\': entries}\\n    return render(request, \\'learning_logs/topic.html\\', context)\\n--snip--'),\n",

After receiving a topic request, we make sure the topic’s \\nuser matches the currently logged-in user before rendering the page. If the \\nrequested topic’s owner is not the same as the current user, we raise the \\nHttp404 exception\\xa02, and Django returns a 404-error page.\\nNow if you try to view another user’s topic entries, you’ll see a “Page Not \\nFound” message from Django. In Chapter\\xa020, we’ll configure the project so \\nusers will see a proper error page instead of a debugging page.\\nProtecting the edit_entry Page\\nThe edit_entry pages have URLs of the form http://localhost:8000/edit_entry/\\nentry_id/, where the entry_id is a number.

We then \\ncheck whether the owner of the topic matches the currently logged-in user; \\nif they don’t match, we raise an Http404 exception.\\nAssociating New Topics with the Current User\\nCurrently, the page for adding new topics is broken because it doesn’t \\nassociate new topics with any particular user. If you try adding a new topic, \\nyou’ll see the message IntegrityError along with NOT NULL constraint failed: \\nlearning_logs_topic.owner_id. Django is saying you can’t create a new topic \\nwithout specifying a value for the topic’s owner field.\\nThere’s a straightforward fix for this problem, because we have access \\nto the current user through the request object. Add the following code, \\nwhich associates the new topic with the current user:\\nlearning_logs/ \\nviews.py\\n--snip--\\n@login_required\\ndef new_topic(request):\\n    --snip--\\n    else:\\n        # POST data submitted; process data.\\n        form = TopicForm(data=request.POST)\\n        if form.is_valid():'),\n",

Refactoring: There are two places in views.py where we make sure the \\nuser associated with a topic matches the currently logged-in user.

Protecting new_entry: Currently, a user can add a new entry to another \\nuser’s learning log by entering a URL with the ID of a topic belonging to \\nanother user. Prevent this attack by checking that the current user owns the \\nentry’s topic before saving the new entry.\\n19-5.

Make sure all posts are publicly accessible but only \\nregistered users can add posts and edit existing posts.

We’ll also add some requirements for using Bootstrap in our templates, \\nand give the page a title.

The \\nhead of the file begins with an opening <head> tag\\xa03. The head of an HTML \\nfile doesn’t hold any of the page’s content; it just tells the browser what it \\nneeds to know to display the page correctly. We include a <title> element for \\nthe page, which will display in the browser’s title bar whenever Learning Log \\nis open\\xa04.\\nBefore closing the head section, we load the collection of template tags \\navailable in django-bootstrap5\\xa0 5. The template tag {% bootstrap_css %} is a \\ncustom tag from django-bootstrap5; it loads all of the CSS files required to \\nimplement Bootstrap styles. The tag that follows enables all the interactive \\nbehavior you might use on a page, such as collapsible navigation bars. The \\nclosing </head> tag appears on the last line.\\nAll Bootstrap styling options are now available in any template that \\ninherits from base.html . If you want to use custom template tags from \\ndjango-bootstrap5, each template will need to include the {% load django \\n_bootstrap5 %} tag.\\nDefining the Navigation Bar\\nThe code that defines the navigation bar at the top of the page is fairly long, \\nbecause it has to work equally well on narrow phone screens and wide desk-\\ntop monitors. We’ll work through the navigation bar in sections.\\nHere’s the first part of the navigation bar:\\nbase.html --snip--\\n</head>\\n<body>\\n1   <nav class=\"navbar navbar-expand-md navbar-light bg-light mb-4 border\">\\n    <div class=\"container-fluid\">\\n2       <a class=\"navbar-brand\" href=\"{% url \\'learning_logs:index\\' %}\">\\n          Learning Log</a>\\n3       <button class=\"navbar-toggler\" type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\"\\n        data-bs-target=\"#navbarCollapse\" aria-controls=\"navbarCollapse\"\\n        aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-label=\"Toggle navigation\">\\n        <span class=\"navbar-toggler-icon\"></span>\\n      </button>\\n4       <div class=\"collapse navbar-collapse\" id=\"navbarCollapse\">\\n5         <ul class=\"navbar-nav me-auto mb-2 mb-md-0\">\\n6           <li class=\"nav-item\">\\n7             <a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"{% url \\'learning_logs:topics\\' %}\">\\n              Topics</a></li>\\n        </ul> <!-- End of links on left side of navbar -->\\n      </div> <!-- Closes collapsible parts of navbar -->\\n    </div> <!-- Closes navbar\\'s container -->\\n  </nav> <!-- End of navbar -->'),\n",

The body of an HTML \\nfile contains the content users will see on a page. Next we have a <nav> ele-\\nment, which opens the code for the navigation bar at the top of the page\\xa01. \\nEverything contained in this element is styled according to the Bootstrap \\nstyle rules defined by the selectors navbar, navbar-expand-md, and the rest that \\nyou see here. A selector determines which elements on a page a certain style \\nrule applies to. The navbar-light and bg-light selectors style the navigation bar \\nwith a light-themed background. The mb in mb-4 is short for margin-bottom; this \\nselector ensures that a little space appears between the navigation bar and \\nthe rest of the page. The border selector provides a thin border around the \\nlight background to set it off a little from the rest of the page.\\nThe <div> tag on the next line opens a resizable container that will hold \\nthe overall navigation bar. The term div is short for division; you build a web \\npage by dividing it into sections and defining style and behavior rules that \\napply to that section. Any styling or behavior rules that are defined in an \\nopening <div> tag affect everything you see until its corresponding closing \\ntag, written as </div>.\\nNext we set the project’s name, Learning Log, to appear as the first ele -\\nment on the navigation bar\\xa0 2. This will also serve as a link to the home \\npage, just as it’s been doing in the minimally styled version of the project we \\nbuilt in the previous two chapters. The navbar-brand selector styles this link \\nso it stands out from the rest of the links and helps add some branding to \\nthe site.\\nThe Bootstrap template then defines a button that appears if the browser \\nwindow is too narrow to display the whole navigation bar horizontally\\xa0 3. \\nWhen the user clicks the button, the navigation elements appear in a drop-\\ndown list. The collapse reference causes the navigation bar to collapse when \\nthe user shrinks the browser window or when the site is displayed on devices \\nwith small screens.\\nNext, we open a new section (<div>) of the navigation bar\\xa0 4. This is the \\npart of the navigation bar that can collapse depending on the size of the \\nbrowser window.\\nBootstrap defines navigation elements as items in an unordered list\\xa0 5, \\nwith style rules that make it look nothing like a list. Every link or element \\nyou need on the bar can be included as an item in an unordered list\\xa0 6. \\nHere, the only item in the list is our link to the topics page\\xa0 7. Notice the \\nclosing </li> tag at the end of the link; every opening tag needs a corre -\\nsponding closing tag.\\nThe rest of the lines shown here close out all of the tags that have been \\nopened. In HTML, a comment is written like this:\\n<!-- This is an HTML comment. -->'),\n",

A single missing \\ntag or an extra tag can throw off the layout of an entire page. We include \\nthe content block\\xa08 and the closing </body> and </html> tags as well.\\nWe’re not finished with the navigation bar, but we now have a complete \\nHTML document. If runserver is currently active, stop the current server \\nand restart it. Go to the project’s home page, and you should see a naviga -\\ntion bar that has some of the elements shown in Figure\\xa020-1. Now let’s add \\nthe rest of the elements to the navigation bar.\\nAdding User Account Links\\nWe still need to add the links associated with user accounts. We’ll start by \\nadding all of the account-related links except the logout form.\\nMake the following changes to base.html:\\nbase.html         --snip--\\n        </ul> <!-- End of links on left side of navbar -->\\n        <!-- Account-related links -->\\n1         <ul class=\"navbar-nav ms-auto mb-2 mb-md-0\">\\n2           {% if user.is_authenticated %}\\n            <li class=\"nav-item\">\\n3               <span class=\"navbar-text me-2\">Hello, {{ user.username }}.\\n                </span></li>\\n4           {% else %}\\n            <li class=\"nav-item\">\\n              <a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"{% url \\'accounts:register\\' %}\">\\n                  Register</a></li>\\n            <li class=\"nav-item\">\\n              <a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"{% url \\'accounts:login\\' %}\">\\n                  Log in</a></li>\\n          {% endif %}\\n        </ul> <!-- End of account-related links -->\\n      </div> <!-- Closes collapsible parts of navbar -->\\n      --snip--\\nWe begin a new set of links by using another opening <ul> tag\\xa01. You \\ncan have as many groups of links as you need on a page. The selector  \\nms-auto is short for margin-start-automatic : this selector examines the other \\nelements in the navigation bar and works out a left (start) margin that \\npushes this group of links to the right side of the browser window.\\nThe if block is the same conditional block we used earlier to display \\nappropriate messages to users, depending on whether they’re logged in\\xa0 2. \\nThe block is a little longer now because there are some styling rules inside \\nthe conditional tags. The greeting for authenticated users is wrapped in a \\n<span> element\\xa03. A span element styles pieces of text or elements of a page \\nthat are part of a longer line.

These should look just \\nlike the link to the topics page.\\nIf you wanted to add more links to the navigation bar, you’d add another \\n<li> item to one of the <ul> groups that we’ve defined, using styling directives \\nlike the ones you’ve seen here.\\nNow let’s add the logout form to the navigation bar.\\nAdding the Logout Form to the Navigation Bar\\nWhen we first wrote the logout form, we added it to the bottom of base.html. \\nNow let’s put it in a better place, in the navigation bar:\\nbase.html         --snip--\\n        </ul> <!-- End of account-related links -->\\n        {% if user.is_authenticated %}\\n          <form action=\"{% url \\'accounts:logout\\' %}\" method=\\'post\\'>\\n            {% csrf_token %}\\n1             <button name=\\'submit\\' class=\\'btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm\\'>\\n                Log out</button>\\n          </form>\\n        {% endif %}\\n      </div> <!-- Closes collapsible parts of navbar -->\\n      --snip--\\nThe logout form should be placed after the set of account-related links, \\nbut inside the collapsible section of the navigation bar.

We need to define \\ntwo blocks that the individual pages can use to place the content specific to \\nthose pages.\\nDefining the Main Part of the Page\\nThe rest of base.html contains the main part of the page:\\nbase.html   --snip--\\n  </nav> <!-- End of navbar -->\\n1   <main class=\"container\">\\n2     <div class=\"pb-2 mb-2 border-bottom\">\\n      {% block page_header %}{% endblock page_header %}\\n    </div>'),\n",

To make this section stand out from the rest of the page, \\nwe place some padding below the header. Padding refers to space between \\nan element’s content and its border. The selector pb-2 is a bootstrap directive \\nthat provides a moderate amount of padding at the bottom of the styled ele-\\nment. A margin is the space between an element’s border and other elements \\non the page. The selector mb-2 provides a moderate amount of margin at the \\nbottom of this div. We want a border on the bottom of this block, so we use \\nthe selector border-bottom, which provides a thin border at the bottom of the \\npage_header block.\\nWe then define one more div element that contains the block content\\xa03. \\nWe don’t apply any specific style to this block, so we can style the content of \\nany page as we see fit for that page. The end of the base.html file has closing \\ntags for the main, body, and html elements.\\nWhen you load Learning Log’s home page in a browser, you should \\nsee a professional-looking navigation bar that matches the one shown in \\nFigure\\xa020-1. Try resizing the window so it’s really narrow; a button should \\nreplace the navigation bar. Click the button, and all the links should appear \\nin a drop-down list.\\nStyling the Home Page Using a Jumbotron\\nTo update the home page, we’ll use a Bootstrap element called a jumbotron, \\na large box that stands out from the rest of the page.

A jumbotron is implemented as a pair of div elements with \\na set of styling directives applied to them\\xa0 2. The outer div has padding and \\nmargin settings, a light background color, and rounded corners. The inner \\ndiv is a container that changes along with the window size and has some \\npadding as well. The py-4 selector adds padding to the top and bottom of \\nthe div element. Feel free to adjust the numbers in these settings and see \\nhow the home page changes.\\nInside the jumbotron are three elements. The first is a short message, \\nTrack your learning , that gives new visitors a sense of what Learning Log \\ndoes\\xa03. The <h1> element is a first-level header, and the display-3 selector \\nadds a thinner and taller look to this particular header. We also include a \\nlonger message that provides more information about what the user can do \\nwith their learning log\\xa0 4. This is formatted as a lead paragraph, which is \\nmeant to stand out from regular paragraphs.\\nRather than just using a text link, we create a button that invites users \\nto register an account on Learning Log\\xa0 5. This is the same link as in the \\nheader, but the button stands out on the page and shows the viewer what \\nthey need to do in order to start using the project. The selectors you see \\nhere style this as a large button that represents a call to action. The code \\n&raquo; is an HTML entity that looks like two right angle brackets combined \\n(>>). Finally, we provide closing div tags and close the page_header block. \\nWith only two div elements in this file, it’s not particularly helpful to label \\nthe closing div tags. We aren’t adding anything else to this page, so we don’t \\nneed to define the content block in this template.\\nThe home page now looks like Figure\\xa020-1. This is a significant improve-\\nment over the unstyled version of the project!\\nStyling the Login Page\\nWe’ve refined the overall appearance of the login page, but the login form \\nitself doesn’t have any styling yet. Let’s make the form look consistent with \\nthe rest of the page by modifying login.html:\\nlogin.html {% extends \\'learning_logs/base.html\\' %}\\n1 {% load django_bootstrap5 %}\\n2 {% block page_header %}\\n  <h2>Log in to your account.</h2>\\n{% endblock page_header %}\\n{% block content %}'),\n",

The  \\n{% booststrap_form %} template tag inserts Bootstrap style rules into the form’s \\nindividual elements as the form is rendered. To generate the submit button, \\nwe use the {% bootstrap_button %} tag with arguments that designate it as a \\nsubmit button, and give it the label Log in 4.\\nFigure\\xa020-2 shows the login form now. The page is much cleaner, with \\nconsistent styling and a clear purpose.

This applies a simple set of styling \\ndirectives to the overall list and to each item in the list. When we open the \\n<ul> tag, we first include the list-group class to apply the default style direc -\\ntives to the list\\xa02. We further customize the list by putting a border at the \\nbottom of the list, a little padding below the list ( pb-2), and a margin below \\nthe bottom border (mb-4).\\nEach item in the list needs the list-group-item class, and we customize \\nthe default style by removing the border around individual items\\xa0 3. The \\nmessage that’s displayed when the list is empty needs these same classes\\xa0 4.\\nWhen you visit the topics page now, you should see a page with styling \\nthat matches the home page.\\nStyling the Entries on the Topic Page\\nOn the topic page, we’ll use Bootstrap’s card component to make each \\nentry stand out. A card is a nestable set of divs with flexible, predefined \\nstyles that are perfect for displaying a topic’s entries:\\ntopic.html {% extends \\'learning_logs/base.html\\' %}\\n1 {% block page_header %}\\n  <h1>{{ topic.text }}</h1>\\n{% endblock page_header %}'),\n",

Then we delete the \\nunordered list structure previously used in this template. Instead of making \\neach entry a list item, we open a div element with the selector card\\xa02. This \\ncard has two nested elements: one to hold the timestamp and the link to \\nedit the entry, and another to hold the body of the entry. The card selector \\ntakes care of most of the styling we need for this div; we customize the card \\nby adding a small margin to the bottom of each card ( mb-3).\\nThe first element in the card is a header, which is an <h4> element with \\nthe selector card-header\\xa03. This header contains the date the entry was \\nmade and a link to edit the entry. The <small> tag around the edit_entry link \\nmakes it appear a little smaller than the timestamp\\xa0 4. The second element \\nis a div with the selector card-body\\xa05, which places the text of the entry in \\na simple box on the card. Notice that the Django code for including the \\ninformation on the page hasn’t changed; only elements that affect the \\nappearance of the page have. Since we no longer have an unordered list, \\nwe’ve replaced the list item tags around the empty list message with simple \\nparagraph tags\\xa0 6.\\nFigure\\xa020-3 shows the topic page with its new look. Learning Log’s \\nfunctionality hasn’t changed, but it looks significantly more professional \\nand inviting to users.\\nIf you want to use a different Bootstrap template for a project, follow a \\nprocess that’s similar to what we’ve done so far in this chapter. Copy the tem-\\nplate you want to use into base.html, and modify the elements that contain \\nactual content so the template displays your project’s information.

You can see the current limits of the free trial at \\nhttps:/ /platform.sh/free-trial.\\nInstalling the Platform.sh CLI\\nTo deploy and manage a project on Platform.sh, you’ll need the tools avail-\\nable in the Command Line Interface (CLI). To install the latest version \\nof the CLI, visit https://docs.platform.sh/development/cli.html  and follow the \\ninstructions for your operating system.\\nOn most systems, you can install the CLI by running the following com -\\nmand in a terminal:\\n$ curl -fsS https://platform.sh/cli/installer | php\\nAfter this command has finished running, you will need to open a new \\nterminal window before you can use the CLI.\\nNOTE  This command will probably not work in a standard terminal on Windows. You \\ncan use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or a Git Bash terminal. If you need to \\ninstall PHP, you can use the XAMPP installer from https:/ /apachefriends.org. If \\nyou have any difficulty installing the Platform.sh CLI, see the more detailed installa -\\ntion instructions in Appendix E.\\nInstalling platformshconfig\\nYou’ll also need to install one additional package, platformshconfig. This \\npackage helps detect whether the project is running on your local system or \\non a Platform.sh server. In an active virtual environment, issue the follow -\\ning command:\\n(ll_env)learning_log$ pip install platformshconfig\\nWe’ll use this package to modify the project’s settings when it’s running \\non the live server.\\nCreating a requirements.txt File\\nThe remote server needs to know which packages Learning Log depends \\non, so we’ll use pip to generate a file listing them. Again, from an active vir -\\ntual environment, issue the following command:\\n(ll_env)learning_log$ pip freeze > requirements.txt\\nThe freeze command tells pip to write the names of all the packages \\ncurrently installed in the project into the file requirements.txt. Open this file \\nto see the packages and version numbers installed in your project:\\nrequirements.txt asgiref==3.5.2\\nbeautifulsoup4==4.11.1\\nDjango==4.1'),\n",

(We installed three of these packages manually, and four of \\nthem were installed automatically as dependencies of these packages.)\\nWhen we deploy Learning Log, Platform.sh will install all the packages \\nlisted in requirements.txt, creating an environment with the same packages \\nwe’re using locally. Because of this, we can be confident the deployed project \\nwill function just like it has on our local system. This approach to managing \\na project is critical as you start to build and maintain multiple projects on \\nyour system.\\nNOTE  If the version number for a package listed on your system differs from what’s shown \\nhere, keep the version you have on your system.\\nAdditional Deployment Requirements\\nThe live server requires two additional packages. These packages are used \\nto serve the project in a production environment, where many users can be \\nmaking requests at the same time.\\nIn the same directory where requirements.txt is saved, make a new file \\ncalled requirements_remote.txt . Add the following two packages to it:\\nrequirements \\n_remote.txt\\n# Requirements for live project.\\ngunicorn\\npsycopg2\\nThe gunicorn package responds to requests as they come in to the \\nremote server; this takes the place of the development server we’ve been \\nusing locally. The psycopg2 package is required to let Django manage the \\nPostgres database that Platform.sh uses. Postgres is an open source database \\nthat’s extremely well suited to production apps.\\nAdding Configuration Files\\nEvery hosting platform requires some configuration for a project to run \\ncorrectly on its servers. In this section, we’ll add three configuration files:\\n.platform.app.yaml  This is the main configuration file for the project. \\nThis tells Platform.sh what kind of project we’re trying to deploy and \\nwhat kinds of resources our project needs, and it includes commands \\nfor building the project on the server.\\n.platform/routes.yaml  This file defines the routes to our project. When \\na request is received by Platform.sh, this is the configuration that helps \\ndirect these requests to our specific project.\\n.platform/services.yaml   This file defines any additional services our \\nproject needs.'),\n",

When you open a file browser, you won’t see these kinds of files \\nand folders by default. But as a programmer, you’ll need to see them. Here’s \\nhow to view hidden files, depending on your operating system:\\n•\\t On Windows, open Windows Explorer, and then open a folder such as \\nDesktop. Click the View tab, and make sure File name extensions  and \\nHidden items  are checked.\\n•\\t On macOS, you can press ⌘-SHIFT-. (dot) in any Finder window to see \\nhidden files and folders.\\n•\\t On Linux systems such as Ubuntu, you can press CTRL-H in any file \\nbrowser to display hidden files and folders. To make this setting per -\\nmanent, open a file browser such as Nautilus and click the options tab \\n(indicated by three lines). Select the Show Hidden Files  checkbox.\\nThe .platform.app.yaml Configuration File\\nThe first configuration file is the longest, because it controls the overall \\ndeployment process.

Here we’re specifying that gunicorn will \\nhandle requests\\xa0 4. This command takes the place of the python manage.py \\nrunserver command we’ve been using locally.\\nThe locations section tells Platform.sh where to send incoming requests\\xa05.  \\nMost requests should be passed through to gunicorn; our urls.py files will tell \\ngunicorn exactly how to handle those requests.

Here’s \\nthe code that goes in .gitignore:\\n.gitignore ll_env/\\n__pycache__/\\n*.sqlite3\\nWe tell Git to ignore the entire ll_env directory, because we can re-create \\nit automatically at any time. We also don’t track the __pycache__  directory, \\nwhich contains the .pyc files that are created automatically when the .py files \\nare executed. We don’t track changes to the local database, because it’s a \\nbad habit: if you’re ever using SQLite on a server, you might accidentally \\noverwrite the live database with your local test database when you push the \\nproject to the server. The asterisk in *.sqlite3 tells Git to ignore any file that \\nends with the extension .sqlite3.'),\n",

Most \\npopular editors have some features that used to be exclusive to IDEs. Likewise, \\nmost IDEs can be configured to run in a lighter mode that’s less distracting as \\nyou work, but lets you use the more advanced features when you need them.\\nIf you already have an editor or IDE installed that you like, and if it’s \\nalready configured to work with a recent version of Python that’s installed \\non your system, then I encourage you to stick with what you already know. \\nExploring different editors can be fun, but it’s also a way to avoid the work \\nof learning a new language.\\nIf you don’t already have an editor or IDE installed, I recommend  \\nVS Code for a number of reasons:\\n•\\t It’s free, and it’s released under an open source license.\\n•\\t It can be installed on all major operating systems.\\n•\\t It’s beginner-friendly but also powerful enough that many professional \\nprogrammers use it as their main editor.\\n•\\t It finds the versions of Python you have installed, and it typically does \\nnot require any configuration to run your first programs.\\n•\\t It has an integrated terminal, so your output appears in the same win -\\ndow as your code.\\n•\\t A Python extension is available that makes the editor highly efficient \\nfor writing and maintaining Python code.\\n•\\t It’s highly customizable, so you can tune it to match the way you work \\nwith code.\\nIn this appendix, you’ll learn how to start configuring VS Code so that \\nit works well for you. You’ll also learn some shortcuts that let you work more \\nefficiently. Being a fast typist is not as important as many people think in \\nprogramming, but understanding your editor and knowing how to use it \\nefficiently is quite helpful.\\nWith all that said, VS Code doesn’t work for everyone. If it doesn’t work \\nwell on your system for some reason, or if it’s distracting you as you work, \\nthere are a number of other editors that you might find more appealing. \\nThis appendix includes a brief description of some of the other editors and \\nIDEs you should consider.\\nWorking Efficiently with VS Code\\nIn Chapter\\xa01, you installed VS Code and added the Python extension as \\nwell. This section will show you some further configurations you can make, \\nplus shortcuts for working efficiently with your code.\\nConfiguring VS Code\\nThere are a few ways to change the default configuration settings for VS Code. \\nSome changes can be made through the interface, and some will require'),\n",

These changes will sometimes take effect for \\neverything you do in VS Code, while others will affect only the files within \\nthe folder that contains the configuration file.\\nFor example, if you have a configuration file in your python_work folder, \\nthose settings will only affect the files in that folder (and its subfolders). \\nThis is a good feature, because it means you can have project-specific set -\\ntings that override your global settings.\\nUsing Tabs and Spaces\\nIf you use a mix of tabs and spaces in your code, it can cause problems in \\nyour programs that are difficult to diagnose. When working in a .py file with \\nthe Python extension installed, VS Code is configured to insert four spaces \\nwhenever you press the TAB key. If you’re writing only your own code and \\nyou have the Python extension installed, you’ll likely never have an issue \\nwith tabs and spaces.\\nHowever, your installation of VS Code may not be configured correctly. \\nAlso, at some point, you may end up working on a file that has only tabs or a \\nmix of tabs and spaces. If you suspect any issue with tabs and spaces, look at \\nthe status bar at the bottom of the VS Code window and click either Spaces \\nor Tab Size . A drop-down menu will appear that lets you switch between \\nusing tabs and using spaces. You can also change the default indentation \\nlevel and convert all indentation in the file to either tabs or spaces.\\nIf you’re looking at some code and you’re not sure whether the indenta-\\ntion consists of tabs or spaces, highlight several lines of code. This will make \\nthe invisible whitespace characters visible. Each space will show up as a dot, \\nand each tab will show up as an arrow.\\nNOTE  In programming, spaces are preferred over tabs because spaces can be interpreted \\nunambiguously by all tools that work with a code file. The width of tabs can be inter -\\npreted differently by different tools, which leads to errors that can be extremely difficult \\nto diagnose.\\nChanging the Color Theme\\nVS Code uses a dark theme by default. If you want to change this, click File \\n(Code in the menu bar on macOS), then click Preferences  and choose \\nColor Theme . A drop-down list will appear, and it will let you choose a \\ntheme that works well for you.\\nSetting the Line Length Indicator\\nMost editors allow you to set up a visual cue, usually a vertical line, to show \\nwhere your lines should end. In the Python community, the convention is to \\nlimit lines to 79 characters or less.\\nTo set this feature, click Code and then Preferences , and then choose \\nSettings .

In the file that \\nappears, add the following to the editor.rulers setting:\\nsettings.json     \"editor.rulers\": [\\n    80,\\n    ]\\nThis will add a vertical line in the editing window at the 80-character \\nposition. You can have more than one vertical line; for example, if you want \\nan additional line at 120 characters, the value for your setting would be \\n[80, 120]. If you don’t see the vertical lines, make sure you saved the settings \\nfile; you may also need to quit and reopen VS Code for the changes to take \\neffect on some systems.\\nSimplifying the Output\\nBy default, VS Code shows the output of your programs in an embedded \\nterminal window. This output includes the commands that are being used \\nto run the file. For many situations, this is ideal, but it might be more dis -\\ntracting than you want when you’re first learning Python.\\nTo simplify the output, close all the tabs that are open in VS Code and \\nthen quit VS Code. Launch VS Code again and open the folder that con -\\ntains the Python files you’re working on; this could just be the python_work \\nfolder where hello_world.py is saved.\\nClick the Run/Debug icon (which looks like a triangle with a small \\nbug), and then click Create a launch.json File. Select the Python options in \\nthe prompts that appear. In the launch.json file that opens, make the follow-\\ning change:\\nlaunch.json {\\n    --snip--\\n    \"configurations\": [\\n        {\\n            --snip--\\n            \"console\": \"internalConsole\",\\n            \"justMyCode\": true\\n        }\\n    ]\\n}\\nHere, we’re changing the console setting from integratedTerminal  to \\ninternalConsole. After saving the settings file, open a .py file such as hello \\n_world.py, and run it by pressing CTRL-F5. In the output pane of VS Code, click \\nDebug Console if it’s not already selected. You should see only your program’s \\noutput, and the output should be refreshed every time you run a program.\\nNOTE  The Debug Console is read-only. It won’t work for files that use the input() function, \\nwhich you’ll start using in Chapter\\xa07. When you need to run these programs, you can \\neither change the console setting back to the default integratedTerminal, or you can \\nrun these programs in a separate terminal window as described in “ Running Python \\nPrograms from a Terminal” on page 11.'),\n",

You’ll see a list titled Commonly Used; click any of \\nthe subheadings to see some common ways you can modify your installation \\nof VS Code. Take some time to see if there are any that make VS Code work \\nbetter for you, but don’t get so lost in configuring your editor that you put off \\nlearning how to use Python!\\nVS Code Shortcuts\\nAll editors and IDEs offer efficient ways to do common tasks that everyone \\nneeds to do when writing and maintaining code. For example, you can eas -\\nily indent a single line of code or an entire block of code; you can just as \\neasily move a block of lines up or down in a file.\\nThere are too many shortcuts to describe fully here. This section will \\nshare just a few that you’ll likely find helpful as you’re writing your first \\nPython files. If you end up using a different editor than VS Code, make sure \\nyou learn how to do these same tasks efficiently in the editor you’ve chosen.\\nIndenting and Unindenting Code Blocks\\nTo indent an entire block of code, highlight it and press CTRL-], or ⌘-] on \\nmacOS. To unindent a block of code, highlight it and press CTRL-[, or ⌘-[ \\non macOS.\\nCommenting Out Blocks of Code\\nTo temporarily disable a block of code, you can highlight the block and \\ncomment it so Python will ignore it. Highlight the section of code you want \\nto ignore and press CTRL-/ , or ⌘-/ on macOS. The selected lines will \\nbe commented out with a hash mark (#) indented at the same level as the \\nline of code, to indicate these are not regular comments. When you want \\nto uncomment the block of code, highlight the block and reissue the same \\ncommand.\\nMoving Lines Up or Down\\nAs your programs grow more complex, you may find that you want to move a \\nblock of code up or down within a file. To do so, highlight the code you want \\nto move and press ALT-up arrow, or Option-up arrow on macOS. The same \\nkey combination with the down arrow will move the block down in the file.\\nIf you’re moving a single line up or down, you can click anywhere in \\nthat line; you don’t need to highlight the whole line to move it.\\nHiding the File Explorer\\nThe integrated file explorer in VS Code is really convenient. However, it can \\nbe distracting when you’re writing code and can take up valuable space on \\na smaller screen. The command CTRL-B, or ⌘-B on macOS, toggles the \\nvisibility of the file explorer pane.'),\n",

When you’re learning to work with code, try to notice the \\nthings you do repeatedly. Any action you take in your editor likely has a \\nshortcut; if you’re clicking menu items to carry out editing tasks, look for \\nthe shortcuts for those actions. If you’re switching between your keyboard \\nand mouse frequently, look for the navigation shortcuts that keep you from \\nreaching for your mouse so often.\\nYou can see all the keyboard shortcuts in VS Code by clicking Code and \\nthen Preferences , and then choosing Keyboard  Shortcuts . You can use the \\nsearch bar to find a particular shortcut, or you can scroll through the list to \\nfind shortcuts that might help you work more efficiently.\\nRemember, it’s better to focus on the code that you’re working on, and \\navoid spending too much time on the tools you’re using.\\nOther Text Editors and IDEs\\nYou’ll hear about and see people using a number of other text editors. Most \\nof them can be configured to help you in the same way you’ve customized \\nVS Code. Here’s a small selection of text editors you might hear about.\\nIDLE\\nIDLE is a text editor that’s included with Python. It’s a little less intuitive to \\nwork with than other, more modern editors. However, you’ll see references \\nto it in other tutorials aimed at beginners, so you might want to give it a try.\\nGeany\\nGeany is a simple text editor that displays all of your output in a separate ter -\\nminal window, which helps you become comfortable using terminals. Geany \\nhas a very minimalist interface, but it’s powerful enough that a significant \\nnumber of experienced programmers still use it.\\nIf you find VS Code too distracting and full of too many features, con -\\nsider using Geany instead.\\nSublime Text\\nSublime Text is another minimalist editor that you should consider using if \\nyou find VS Code too busy. Sublime Text has a really clean interface and is \\nknown for working well even on very large files. It’s an editor that will get \\nout of your way and let you focus on the code you’re writing.\\nSublime Text has an unlimited free trial, but it’s not free or open \\nsource. If you decide you like it and can afford to purchase a full license, \\nyou should do so. The purchase is a one-time fee; it’s not a software \\nsubscription.'),\n",

This makes writing, reading, and \\nmodifying code very efficient, once you learn how the editor works. It also \\nmeans both editors have a fairly steep learning curve. Vim is included on \\nmost Linux and macOS machines, and both Emacs and Vim can be run \\nentirely inside a terminal. For this reason, they’re often used to write code \\non servers through remote terminal sessions.\\nProgrammers will often recommend that you give them a try, but many \\nproficient programmers forget how much new programmers are already \\ntrying to learn. It’s good to be aware of these editors, but you should hold \\noff on using them until you’re comfortable working with code in a more \\nuser-friendly editor that lets you focus on learning to program, rather than \\nlearning to use an editor.\\nPyCharm\\nPyCharm is a popular IDE among Python programmers because it was built \\nto work specifically with Python. The full version requires a paid subscrip -\\ntion, but a free version called the PyCharm Community Edition is also \\navailable, and many developers find it useful.\\nIf you try PyCharm, be aware that, by default, it sets up an isolated envi -\\nronment for each of your projects. This is usually a good thing, but it can \\nlead to unexpected behavior if you don’t understand what it’s doing for you.\\nJupyter Notebooks\\nJupyter Notebook is a different kind of tool than traditional text editors or \\nIDEs, in that it’s a web app primarily built of blocks; each block is either a \\ncode block or a text block. The text blocks are rendered in Markdown, so \\nyou can include simple formatting in your text blocks.\\nJupyter Notebooks were developed to support the use of Python in \\nscientific applications, but they have since expanded to become useful in \\na wide variety of situations. Rather than just writing comments inside a .py \\nfile, you can write clear text with simple formatting, such as headers, bul -\\nleted lists, and hyperlinks in between sections of code. Every code block can \\nbe run independently, allowing you to test small pieces of your program, or \\nyou can run all the code blocks at once. Each code block has its own output \\narea, and you can toggle the output areas on or off as needed.\\nJupyter Notebooks can be confusing at times because of the interactions \\nbetween different cells. If you define a function in one cell, that function is \\navailable to other cells as well. This is beneficial most of the time, but it can \\nbe confusing in longer notebooks and if you don’t fully understand how the \\nNotebook environment works.\\nIf you’re doing any scientific or data-focused work in Python, you’ll \\nalmost certainly see Jupyter Notebooks at some point.'),\n",

So, one of \\nthe most important skills to learn as a pro -\\ngrammer is how to get unstuck efficiently. This \\nappendix outlines several ways to help you get going \\nagain when programming gets confusing.\\nFirst Steps\\nWhen you’re stuck, your first step should be to assess your situation. Before \\nyou ask for help from anyone else, answer the following three questions \\nclearly:\\n•\\t What are you trying to do?\\n•\\t What have you tried so far?\\n•\\t What results have you been getting?'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/Emailing Eric Matthes - Python Crash Course-No Starch Press (2023) (3).pdf', 'page': 515}, page_content='478\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Appendix C\\nMake your answers as specific as possible. For the first question, explicit \\nstatements like “I’m trying to install the latest version of Python on my new \\nWindows laptop” are detailed enough for others in the Python community \\nto help you. Statements like “I’m trying to install Python” don’t provide \\nenough information for others to offer much help.\\nYour answer to the second question should provide enough detail so \\nyou won’t be advised to repeat what you’ve already tried: “I went to https://\\npython.org/downloads and clicked the Download button for my system. Then \\nI ran the installer” is more helpful than “I went to the Python website and \\ndownloaded something.”\\nFor the third question, it’s helpful to know the exact error messages \\nyou received, so you can use them to search online for a solution or provide \\nthem when asking for help.\\nSometimes, just answering these three questions before you ask for help \\nfrom others allows you to see something you’re missing, and helps get you \\nunstuck without having to go any further. Programmers even have a name \\nfor this: rubber duck debugging . The idea is that if you clearly explain your \\nsituation to a rubber duck (or any inanimate object) and ask it a specific \\nquestion, you’ll often be able to answer your own question. Some program -\\nming teams even keep a real rubber duck around to encourage people to \\n“talk to the duck.”\\nTry It Again\\nJust going back to the start and trying again can be enough to solve many \\nproblems. Say you’re trying to write a for loop based on an example in this \\nbook. You might have only missed something simple, like a colon at the end \\nof the for line. Going through the steps again might help you avoid repeat-\\ning the same mistake.\\nTake a Break\\nIf you’ve been working on the same problem for a while, taking a break is \\none of the best tactics you can try. When we work on the same task for long \\nperiods of time, our brains start to zero in on only one solution. We lose \\nsight of the assumptions we’ve made, and taking a break helps us get a fresh \\nperspective on the problem. It doesn’t need to be a long break, just some-\\nthing that gets you out of your current mindset. If you’ve been sitting for a \\nlong time, do something physical: take a short walk, go outside for a bit, or \\nperhaps drink a glass of water or eat a light snack.\\nIf you’re getting frustrated, it might be worth putting your work away \\nfor the day. A good night’s sleep almost always makes a problem more \\napproachable.\\nRefer to This Book’s Resources\\nThe online resources for this book, available at https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e, \\ninclude a number of helpful sections about setting up your system and work-\\ning through each chapter.

For \\nexample, say you get the following error when you try to run a Python pro -\\ngram from a terminal on a new Windows system:\\n> python hello_world.py\\nPython was not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft\\n  Store...\\nSearching for the full phrase, “Python was not found; run without argu -\\nments to install from the Microsoft Store,” will probably yield some good \\nadvice.\\nWhen you start searching for programming-related topics, a few sites \\nwill appear repeatedly. I’ll describe some of these sites briefly, so you’ll \\nknow how helpful they’re likely to be.\\nStack Overflow\\nStack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com) is one of the most popular question-\\nand-answer sites for programmers, and it will often appear in the first page \\nof results on Python-related searches. Members post questions when they’re \\nstuck, and other members try to give helpful responses. Users can vote for \\nthe responses they find most helpful, so the best answers are usually the \\nfirst ones you’ll find.\\nMany basic Python questions have very clear answers on Stack Overflow, \\nbecause the community has refined them over time. Users are encouraged \\nto post updates, too, so responses tend to stay relatively current. At the \\ntime of this writing, almost two million Python-related questions have been \\nanswered on Stack Overflow.\\nThere’s one expectation you should be aware of before posting on \\nStack Overflow. Questions are meant to be the shortest example of the \\nkind of issue you’re facing. If you post 5–20 lines of code that generate the \\nerror you’re facing, and if you address the questions mentioned in “First \\nSteps” on page 477 earlier in this appendix, someone will probably help \\nyou. If you share a link to a project with multiple large files, people will be \\nvery unlikely to help. There’s a great guide to writing up a good question \\nat https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask. The suggestions in this guide are \\napplicable to getting help in any community of programmers.\\nThe Official Python Documentation\\nThe official Python documentation ( https://docs.python.org ) is a bit more \\nhit-or-miss for beginners, because its purpose is more to document the'),\n",

This \\nis especially critical in large projects, but can also be helpful in smaller proj-\\nects, even when you’re working on programs contained in a single file.\\nIn this appendix, you’ll learn to install Git and use it for version control in \\nthe programs you’re working on now. Git is the most popular version control \\nsoftware in use today. Many of its advanced tools help teams collaborate on \\nlarge projects, but its most basic features also work well for solo developers. \\nGit implements version control by tracking the changes made to every file in a \\nproject; if you make a mistake, you can just return to a previously saved state.'),\n",

The following sections provide specific instruc -\\ntions for each operating system.\\nGit is included on some systems by default, and is often bundled with \\nother packages that you might have already installed. Before trying to install \\nGit, see if it’s already on your system. Open a new terminal window and issue \\nthe command git --version. If you see output listing a specific version num-\\nber, Git is installed on your system. If you see a message prompting you to \\ninstall or update Git, follow the onscreen instructions.\\nIf you don’t see any onscreen instructions and you’re using Windows or \\nmacOS, you can download an installer from https://git-scm.com. If you’re a \\nLinux user with an apt-compatible system, you can install Git with the com -\\nmand sudo apt install git.\\nConfiguring Git\\nGit keeps track of who makes changes to a project, even when only one per-\\nson is working on the project. To do this, Git needs to know your username \\nand email. You must provide a username, but you can make up a fake email \\naddress:\\n$ git config --global user.name \"username\"\\n$ git config --global user.email \"username@example.com\"\\nIf you forget this step, Git will prompt you for this information when \\nyou make your first commit.\\nIt’s also best to set the default name for the main branch in each proj -\\nect. A good name for this branch is main:\\n$ git config --global init.defaultBranch main\\nThis configuration means that each new project you use Git to manage \\nwill start out with a single branch of commits called main.\\nMaking a Project\\nLet’s make a project to work with. Create a folder somewhere on your sys-\\ntem called git_practice . Inside the folder, make a simple Python program:\\nhello_git.py print(\"Hello Git world!\")\\nWe’ll use this program to explore Git’s basic functionality.\\nIgnoring Files\\nFiles with the extension .pyc are automatically generated from .py files, so we \\ndon’t need Git to keep track of them. These files are stored in a directory'),\n",

To tell Git to ignore this directory, make a special  \\nfile called .gitignore—with a dot at the beginning of the filename and no file \\nextension—and add the following line to it:\\n.gitignore __pycache__/\\nThis file tells Git to ignore any file in the __pycache__  directory. Using a \\n.gitignore file will keep your project clutter-free and easier to work with.\\nYou might need to modify your file browser’s settings so hidden files \\n(files whose names begin with a dot) will be shown. In Windows Explorer, \\ncheck the box in the View menu labeled Hidden Items . On macOS, press \\n⌘-SHIFT-. (dot).

Add the name .DS_Store; these \\nare hidden files that contain information about each directory on macOS, and they \\nwill clutter up your project if you don’t add them to .gitignore.\\nInitializing a Repository\\nNow that you have a directory containing a Python file and a .gitignore file, \\nyou can initialize a Git repository. Open a terminal, navigate to the git_practice \\nfolder, and run the following command:\\ngit_practice$ git init\\nInitialized empty Git repository in git_practice/.git/\\ngit_practice$\\nThe output shows that Git has initialized an empty repository in  \\ngit_practice . A repository is the set of files in a program that Git is actively \\ntracking. All the files Git uses to manage the repository are located in the \\nhidden directory .git, which you won’t need to work with at all. Just don’t \\ndelete that directory, or you’ll lose your project’s history.\\nChecking the Status\\nBefore doing anything else, let’s look at the project’s status:\\ngit_practice$ git status\\n1 On branch main\\nNo commits yet\\n2 Untracked files:\\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\\n      .gitignore\\n      hello_git.py\\n3 nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\\ngit_practice$'),\n",

The remote environ -\\nment differs from a typical local system in a number of important ways: it’s \\nprobably not the same operating system (OS) as the one you’re using, and \\nit’s most likely one of many virtual servers on a single physical server.\\nWhen you deploy a project, or push it to the remote server, the following \\nsteps need to be taken:\\n•\\t Create a virtual server on a physical machine at a datacenter.\\n•\\t Establish a connection between the local system and the remote server.\\n•\\t Copy the project’s code to the remote server.\\n•\\t Identify all of the project’s dependencies and install them on the \\nremote server.\\n•\\t Set up a database and run any existing migrations.\\n•\\t Copy static files (CSS, JavaScript files, and media files) to a place where \\nthey can be served efficiently.\\n•\\t Start a server to handle incoming requests.\\n•\\t Start routing incoming requests to the project, once it’s ready to handle \\nrequests.\\nWhen you consider all that goes into a deployment, it’s no wonder \\ndeployments often fail. Fortunately, once you gain an understanding of \\nwhat should be happening, you’ll stand a better chance of identifying what \\nwent wrong. If you can identify what went wrong, you might be able to iden-\\ntify a fix that will make the next deployment attempt successful.\\nYou can develop locally on one kind of OS and push to a server running \\na different OS. It’s important to know what kind of system you’re pushing to, \\nbecause that can inform some of your troubleshooting work. At the time of \\nthis writing, a basic remote server on Platform.sh runs Debian Linux; most \\nremote servers are Linux-based systems.\\nBasic Troubleshooting\\nSome troubleshooting steps are specific to each OS, but we’ll get to that in \\na moment. First, let’s consider the steps everyone should try when trouble-\\nshooting a deployment.\\nYour best resource is the output generated during the attempted \\npush. This output can look intimidating; if you’re new to deploying apps, \\nit can look highly technical, and there’s usually a lot of it. The good news \\nis you don’t need to understand everything in the output.

For example, here’s the mes-\\nsage you’ll see if you create a Platform.sh project before initializing a Git \\nrepository, and then try to push the project:\\n$ platform push\\n1 Enter a number to choose a project:\\n  [0] ll_project (votohz445ljyg)\\n > 0\\n2   [RootNotFoundException]\\n  Project root not found. This can only be run from inside a project\\n    directory.\\n3  To set the project for this Git repository, run:\\n    platform project:set-remote [id]\\nWe’re trying to push a project, but the local project hasn’t been associ-\\nated with a remote project yet. So, the Platform.sh CLI asks which remote \\nproject we want to push to\\xa01. We enter 0, to select the only project listed. \\nBut next, we see a RootNotFoundException\\xa02. This happens because Platform.sh  \\nlooks for a .git directory when it inspects the local project, to figure out \\nhow to connect the local project with the remote project. In this case, since \\nthere was no .git directory when the remote project was created, that con -\\nnection was never established. The CLI suggests a fix\\xa0 3; it’s telling us that \\nwe can specify the remote project that should be associated with this local \\nproject, using the project:set-remote command.\\nLet’s try this suggestion:\\n$ platform project:set-remote votohz445ljyg\\nSetting the remote project for this repository to: ll_project (votohz445ljyg)\\nThe remote project for this repository is\\n    now set to: ll_project (votohz445ljyg)\\nIn the previous output, the CLI showed the ID of this remote project, \\nvotohz4451jyg. So we run the command that’s suggested, using this ID, and \\nthe CLI is able to make the connection between the local project and the \\nremote project.\\nNow let’s try to push the project again:\\n$ platform push\\nAre you sure you want to push to the main (production) branch? [Y/n] y\\nPushing HEAD to the existing environment main\\n--snip--\\nThis was a successful push; following the onscreen suggestion worked.'),\n",

However, if you have good reason to believe that a command \\ncan do little harm, and if you trust the source of the recommendation, it \\nmight be reasonable to try the suggestions offered by the tools you’re using.\\nNOTE  Keep in mind there are individuals who will tell you to run commands that will wipe \\nyour system or expose your system to remote exploitation. Following the suggestions of \\na tool provided by a company or organization you trust is different from following the \\nsuggestions of random people online. Anytime you’re dealing with remote connections, \\nproceed with an abundance of caution.\\nRead the Log Output\\nAs mentioned earlier, the log output that you see when you run a command \\nlike platform push can be both informative and intimidating. Read through \\nthe following snippet of log output, taken from a different attempt at using \\nplatform push, and see if you can spot the issue:\\n--snip--\\nCollecting soupsieve==2.3.2.post1\\n  Using cached soupsieve-2.3.2.post1-py3-none-any.whl (37 kB)\\nCollecting sqlparse==0.4.2\\n  Using cached sqlparse-0.4.2-py3-none-any.whl (42 kB)\\nInstalling collected packages: platformshconfig, sqlparse,...\\nSuccessfully installed Django-4.1 asgiref-3.5.2 beautifulsoup4-4.11.1...\\nW: ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement gunicorrn\\nW: ERROR: No matching distribution found for gunicorrn\\n130 static files copied to '/app/static'.\\nExecuting pre-flight checks...\\n--snip--\\nWhen a deployment attempt fails, a good strategy is to look through \\nthe log output and see if you can spot anything that looks like warnings or \\nerrors. Warnings are fairly common; they’re often messages about upcom -\\ning changes in a project’s dependencies, to help developers address issues \\nbefore they cause actual failures.\\nA successful push may have warnings, but it shouldn’t have any errors. \\nIn this case, Platform.sh couldn’t find a way to install the requirement \\ngunicorrn. This is a typo in the requirements_remote.txt file, which was sup-\\nposed to include gunicorn (with one r). It’s not always easy to spot the root \\nissue in log output, especially when the problem causes a bunch of cascad -\\ning errors and warnings. Just like when reading a traceback on your local \\nsystem, it’s a good idea to look closely at the first few errors that are listed, \\nand also the last few errors. Most of the errors in between tend to be inter -\\nnal packages complaining that something went wrong, and passing mes -\\nsages about the error to other internal packages. The actual error we can \\nfix is usually one of the first or last errors listed.\"),\n",

It’s certainly worth a try, and using log out -\\nput to successfully diagnose an error is a tremendously satisfying feeling. As \\nyou spend more time looking through log output, you’ll get better at identi-\\nfying the information that’s most meaningful to you.\\nOS-Specific Troubleshooting\\nYou can develop on any operating system you like and push to any host \\nyou like. The tools for pushing projects have developed enough that they’ll \\nmodify your project as needed to run correctly on the remote system. \\nHowever, there are some OS-specific issues that can arise.\\nIn the Platform.sh deployment process, one of the most likely sources \\nof difficulties is installing the CLI. Here’s the command to do so:\\n$ curl -fsS https://platform.sh/cli/installer | php\\nThe command starts with curl, a tool that lets you request remote \\nresources, accessed through a URL, within a terminal. Here, it’s being used \\nto download the CLI installer from a Platform.sh server. The -fsS section of \\nthe command is a set of flags that modify how curl runs. The f flag tells curl \\nto suppress most error messages, so the CLI installer can handle them instead \\nof reporting them all to you. The s flag tells curl to run silently; it lets the CLI \\ninstaller decide what information to show in the terminal. The S flag tells curl \\nto show an error message if the overall command fails. The | php at the end \\nof the command tells your system to run the downloaded installer file using a \\nPHP interpreter, because the Platform.sh CLI is written in PHP.\\nThis means your system needs curl and PHP in order to install the \\nPlatform.sh CLI. To use the CLI, you’ll also need Git, and a terminal that \\ncan run Bash commands. Bash is a language that’s available in most server \\nenvironments. Most modern systems have plenty of room for multiple tools \\nlike this to be installed.\\nThe following sections will help you address these requirements for \\nyour OS. If you don’t already have Git installed, see the instructions for \\ninstalling Git on page 484 in Appendix D and then go to the section here \\nthat’s applicable to your OS.\\nNOTE  An excellent tool for understanding terminal commands like the one shown here is \\nhttps:/ /explainshell.com. Enter the command you’re trying to understand, and  \\nthe site will show you the documentation for all the parts of your command. Try it \\nout with the command used to install the Platform.sh CLI.\\nDeploying from Windows\\nWindows has seen a resurgence in popularity with programmers in recent \\nyears. Windows has integrated many different elements of other operating \\nsystems, providing users with a number of options for how to do local devel -\\nopment work and interact with remote systems.'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/Emailing Eric Matthes - Python Crash Course-No Starch Press (2023) (3).pdf', 'page': 535}, page_content='498\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Appendix E\\nOne of the most significant difficulties in deploying from Windows is \\nthat the core Windows operating system is not the same as what a Linux-\\nbased remote server uses. A base Windows system has a different set of tools \\nand languages than a base Linux system, so to carry out deployment work \\nfrom Windows, you’ll need to choose how to integrate Linux-based tool sets \\ninto your local environment.\\nWindows Subsystem for Linux\\nOne popular approach is to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), an envi-\\nronment that allows Linux to run directly on Windows. If you have WSL \\nset up, using the Platform.sh CLI on Windows becomes as easy as using it \\non Linux. The CLI won’t know it’s running on Windows; it will just see the \\nLinux environment you’re using it in.\\nSetting up WSL is a two-step process: you first install WSL, and then \\nchoose a Linux distribution to install into the WSL environment. Setting up \\na WSL environment is more than can be described here; if you’re interested \\nin this approach and don’t already have it set up, see the documentation at \\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about. Once you have WSL set up, \\nyou can follow the instructions in the Linux section of this appendix to con -\\ntinue your deployment work.\\nGit Bash\\nAnother approach to building a local environment that you can deploy \\nfrom uses Git Bash , a terminal environment that’s compatible with Bash \\nbut runs on Windows. Git Bash is installed along with Git when you use \\nthe installer from https://git-scm.com. This approach can work, but it isn’t as \\nstreamlined as WSL. In this approach, you’ll have to use a Windows termi -\\nnal for some steps and a Git Bash terminal for others.\\nFirst you’ll need to install PHP. You can do this with XAMPP, a package \\nthat bundles PHP with a few other developer-focused tools. Go to https://\\napachefriends.org  and click the button to download XAMPP for Windows. \\nOpen the installer and run it; if you see a warning about User Account \\nControl (UAC) restrictions, click OK. Accept all of the installer’s defaults.\\nWhen the installer finishes running, you’ll need to add PHP to your \\nsystem’s path; this will tell Windows where to look when you want to run \\nPHP. In the Start menu, enter path and click Edit the System Environment \\nVariables; click the button labeled Environment Variables . You should see \\nthe variable Path highlighted; click Edit under this pane. Click New to add \\na new path to the current list of paths. Assuming you kept the default set -\\ntings when running the XAMPP installer, add C:\\\\xampp\\\\php in the box that \\nappears, then click OK. When you’re finished, close all of the system dia-\\nlogs that are still open.\\nWith these requirements taken care of, you can install the Platform.sh \\nCLI. You’ll need to use a Windows terminal with administrator privileges; \\nenter command into the Start menu, and under the Command Prompt app,'),\n",

In the terminal that appears, enter the follow -\\ning command:\\n> curl -fsS https://platform.sh/cli/installer | php\\nThis will install the Platform.sh CLI, as described earlier.\\nFinally, you’ll work in Git Bash. To open a Git Bash terminal, go to the \\nStart menu and search for git bash. Click the Git Bash app  that appears; \\nyou should see a terminal window open. You can use traditional Linux-\\nbased commands like ls in this terminal, as well as Windows-based com -\\nmands like dir. To make sure the installation was successful, issue the \\nplatform list command. You should see a list of all the commands in the \\nPlatform.sh CLI. From this point forward, carry out all of your deployment \\nwork using the Platform.sh CLI inside a Git Bash terminal window.\\nDeploying from macOS\\nThe macOS operating system is not based on Linux, but they were both \\ndeveloped on similar principles. What this means, practically, is that a lot of \\nthe commands and workflows that you use on macOS will work in a remote \\nserver environment as well. You might need to install some developer-focused \\nresources in order to have all of these tools available in your local macOS \\nenvironment. If you get a prompt to install the command line developer tools at \\nany point in your work, click Install  to approve the installation.\\nThe most likely difficulty when installing the Platform.sh CLI is mak -\\ning sure PHP is installed. If you see a message that the php command is not \\nfound, you’ll need to install PHP. One of the easiest ways to install PHP is \\nby using the Homebrew package manager, which facilitates the installation \\nof a wide variety of packages that programmers depend on. If you don’t \\nalready have Homebrew installed, visit https://b re w.sh and follow the instruc-\\ntions to install it.\\nOnce Homebrew is installed, use the following command to install PHP:\\n$ brew install php\\nThis will take a while to run, but once it has completed, you should be \\nable to successfully install the Platform.sh CLI.\\nDeploying from Linux\\nBecause most server environments are Linux-based, you should have very \\nlittle difficulty installing and using the Platform.sh CLI. If you try to install \\nthe CLI on a system with a fresh installation of Ubuntu, it will tell you \\nexactly which packages you need:\\n$ curl -fsS https://platform.sh/cli/installer | php\\nCommand 'curl' not found, but can be installed with:\\nsudo apt  install curl\\nCommand 'php' not found, but can be installed with:\\nsudo apt install php-cli\"),\n",

The following com -\\nmand will install curl and PHP:\\n$ sudo apt install curl php-cli\\nAfter running this command, the Platform.sh CLI installation com -\\nmand should run successfully. Since your local environment is quite similar \\nto most Linux-based hosting environments, much of what you learn about \\nworking in your terminal will carry over to working in a remote environ -\\nment as well.\\nOther Deployment Approaches\\nIf Platform.sh doesn’t work for you, or if you want to try a different approach, \\nthere are many hosting platforms to choose from. Some work similarly to the \\nprocess described in Chapter\\xa020, and some have a much different approach \\nto carrying out the steps described at the beginning of this appendix:\\n•\\t Platform.sh allows you to use a browser to carry out the steps we used \\nthe CLI for. If you like browser-based interfaces better than terminal-\\nbased workflows, you may prefer this approach.\\n•\\t There are a number of other hosting providers that offer both CLI- and \\nbrowser-based approaches. Some of these providers offer terminals \\nwithin their browser, so you don’t have to install anything on your \\nsystem.\\n•\\t Some providers allow you to push your project to a remote code hosting \\nsite like GitHub, and then connect your GitHub repository to the host-\\ning site. The host then pulls your code from GitHub, instead of requir -\\ning you to push your code from your local system directly to the host. \\nPlatform.sh supports this kind of workflow as well.\\n•\\t Some providers offer an array of services that you select from, in \\norder to put together an infrastructure that works for your project. \\nThis typically requires you to have a deeper understanding of the \\ndeployment process, and what a remote server needs in order to \\nserve a project. These hosts include Amazon Web Services (AWS) and \\nMicrosoft’s Azure platform. It can be much harder to track your costs \\nin these kinds of platforms, because each service can accrue charges \\nindependently.\\n•\\t Many people host their projects on a virtual private server (VPS). In this \\napproach, you rent a virtual server that acts just like a remote computer, \\nlog in to the server, install the software needed to run your project, copy \\nyour code over, set the right connections, and allow your server to start \\naccepting requests.\\nNew hosting platforms and approaches appear on a regular basis; find \\none that looks appealing to you, and invest the time to learn that provider’s \\ndeployment process. Maintain your project long enough so that you get to'),\n",

No \\nhosting platform is going to be perfect; you’ll need to make an ongoing \\njudgement call about whether the provider you’re currently using is good \\nenough for your use case.\\nI’ll offer one last word of caution about choosing a deployment plat-\\nform and an overall approach to deployment. Some people will enthusiasti -\\ncally steer you toward overly complex deployment approaches and services \\nthat are meant to make your project highly reliable and capable of serving \\nmillions of users simultaneously. Many programmers spend lots of time, \\nmoney, and energy building out a complex deployment strategy, only to \\nfind that hardly anyone is using their project. Most Django projects can be \\nset up on a small hosting plan and tuned to serve thousands of requests per \\nminute. If your project is getting anything less than this level of traffic, take \\nthe time to configure your deployment to work well on a minimal platform \\nbefore investing in infrastructure that’s meant for some of the largest sites \\nin the world.\\nDeployment is incredibly challenging at times, but just as satisfying \\nwhen your live project works well. Enjoy the challenge, and ask for help \\nwhen you need it.'),\n",
